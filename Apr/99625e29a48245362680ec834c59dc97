The Department of Higher Education and Training expects that 40% of first-time university students will benefit from its expanded bursary scheme meant to open the doors to higher learning for poor students. Speaking during a press briefing in Cape Town, Minister of Higher Education and Training, Naledi Pandor said that 485 875 new student entrants at universities will receive the bursary although the final number of funded students would only become available later in the year. “We have instructed all universities to keep within their enrolment targets, which determines how many students and in which fields of study, can be admitted to each university,” she said. According to Pandor, over 400 000 students have currently applied for National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) which she said will later in the year confirm the final number of students who are eligible for financial funding criteria. Last year government announced free education for students, whose parents’ combined annual income is R350 000 or less. During the budget speech in February, additional funding of R7 Billion was announced to fund bursaries. Pandor added that although first-time students won’t be expected to pay back their bursaries they will be expected to meet conditions including academic performance however the exact conditions are still being finalised. Meanwhile, 90% of TVET colleague students are also set to benefit from the expanded scheme. The minister added that since various student organisations have raised concerns about allowance payments not being processed she decided that all NSFAS processes and systems be assessed to address all problems brought to her attention. “We simply cannot fail to distribute funding to students when it is available,” she said. Back in December last year, former President Jacob Zuma dropped a bombshell announcement that poor and “missing middle” students will receive a free education at tertiary institutions. -TNA Reporter
