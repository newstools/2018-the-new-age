Olympic champion Caster Semenya may soon be forced to take pills to lower her testosterone levels in order to continue competing. This is according to new Eligibility Regulations for Female Classification (Athlete with Differences of Sexual Development) by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The regulations are to directly affect Semenya and will be for events from 400m, hurdles races, 800m, 1500m, and combined events over the same distances (‘Restricted Events’). Semenya competes in two of these divisions. In a statement the IAAF said the new regulations will require any athlete with a Difference of Sexual Development (DSD) to reduce her blood testosterone level to below five (5) nmol/L for a continuous period of at least six months (e.g., by use of hormonal contraceptives) in order to be considered eligible to compete in the Restricted Events. The regulations will also require the athletes to be recognised by law either as female or as intersex (or equivalent) in order for them to compete. The IAAF said that these regulations are expected to come into effect from 1 November 2018. “As the International Federation for our sport, we have a responsibility to ensure a level playing field for athletes. Like many other sports, we choose to have two classifications for our competition – men’s events and women’s events. “This means we need to be clear about the competition criteria for these two categories,” Dr Stephane Bermon from the IAAF Medical and Science Department said. In 2009 Semenya was accused of having an advantage over other athletes where the IAAF proposed for her to undergone a gender verification procedure. Semenya recently broke Zola Pieterse’s 34-year-old national 1500 metre-record to claim the women’s 1500m gold medal in this year’s Commonwealth Games. -TNA Reporter
