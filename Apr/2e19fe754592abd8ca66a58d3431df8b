VENTRILOQUIST Conrad Koch is set to bring his latest production Funny Guy to Johannesburg this week. The show is set to move away from Koch’s usual political discourse to a more “fun-filled” stage production. It is in association with Comedy Central Africa and takes place for the first time in Joburg at the Pieter Toerien Studio Theatre at Montecasino. “It is about playing and fun. There is a space for South Africans to get along which does not compromise what happened, doesn’t pull in the rainbow nation, it can be a safe space and laugh and have fun together while acknowledging the inequality in the past,” Koch said. Featuring his sidekick puppet Chester Missing, the show has four central puppets which are interactive and has a number of props. “So it’s just really a fun show. I do Snapchat on stage, I do DJ Hoodie (made from sunglasses and a hoodie). He is an actual DJ puppet, so I DJ live. I put my hoodie on my feet, it’s insanely funny.” Koch said he took three years to prepare and set up the show. He will be taking the show abroad, travelling to Canada and Australia. He said he was trying to push his art form to be truly world class. The show has already received raving reviews in Cape Town where it has been showing. Explaining Missing’s race evolution, Koch said the puppet was used as a black man talking through a white man to deconstruct race while pointing out the legacy of apartheid and privilege. He said it was more about dealing with fun jokes and creating a warm space for all types of identities as opposed to lecturing people. “Chester has always been a puppet. He is me so he is white. The reason I moved away from that (Chester Missing being brown) was because I felt that I was done with that conversation. I had said what I needed to say. If I continued with it, it would be like I was benefiting from apartheid twice.” Puppet Guy starts at Montecasino from tomorrow and is on until May 27. lillians@thenewage.co.za
