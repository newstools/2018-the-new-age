The Department of Labour will on Tuesday meet with unions to resolve the ongoing strike by bus operators. The nationwide bus strike has entered its seventh day as workers protest over wages and better working conditions. Workers initially demanded a 12% increase while the employer was offering a 7% increase. The workers have lately rejected an 8% increase offer for the first year that is being offered by the employer. They are demanding a 9.5% increase in the first year and 9% in the second year. Transport and Allied Workers’ Union (SATAWU) spokesperson Zanele Sabela said that they will be meeting the department on Tuesday with expectations of a difficult encounter. However, hoped that the meeting will “come out with something”. “If past behaviour is any indication of future behaviour, we are not expecting a walk in the park.” Beyond the salary increases, the bus operators have grievances with the compensation of secondary drivers who are not being paid meanwhile they are making the trip. “That issue about dual drivers and the fact that they don’t really get paid when they go on a trip, the night shift and the insourcing of cleaners are the issues that we are concerned about,” Sabela said. Bus operations including Rea Vaya and other operators remain suspended as the strike continues. -TNA Reporter
