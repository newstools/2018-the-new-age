Today marks the 17th anniversary of the Ellis Park disaster in which 43 people lost their lives during a match between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. It was on this day in 2001 when the tragedy, which happened in the evening, saw spectators pour into Ellis Park for the biggest match in South Africa. The stadium was packed to capacity with 60 000 fans but a further 30 000 tried to force their way in, causing a stampede in which fans and children lost their lives. NEVER FORGOTTEN: Seventeen years later, the families who lost their loved ones at Ellis Park still come over to the stadium to commemorate the day. Some supporters including Dejan Miladinovic (Pirates) and Masilo Machaka (Chiefs) are there every year. #EllisPark43 #FARPost pic.twitter.com/ptZTObfl7J — FARPost (@FarPostSA) April 11, 2018 Ellis Park Disaster To the soldiers we lost 17 years ago, we carry your memories in our hearts forever.
