LIMPOPO police say they have made a major breakthrough – arresting five suspects in connection with the gruesome killing of six mineworkers inside a bus on Monday night. The suspects are aged between 21 and 30. Provincial commissioner Nneke Ledwaba said yesterday that a high-level investigation team established to track down the killers spent two sleepless nights since the incident was reported before making the arrests. The accused will appear in the Mecklenburg Magistrate’s Court today on six counts of murder, malicious damage to property and attempted murder. The difficult process of identifying the dead miners has now commenced. Ledwaba commended members of the investigating team for their “sterling detective work” and the speed in which they managed to make arrests of the suspected killers. Police investigations are continuing and more arrests are not ruled out. Police issued a reward of R500000 for information that could lead to the arrest of suspects. The task team comprised members of the Hawks and organised crime and crime intelligence units. The six victims were burnt beyond recognition. The gruesome incident took place at Driekop, near Burgersfort, when the bus stopped at a pick-up point around 8pm. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the bus was carrying about 50 mineworkers and that 28 passengers were taken to hospital after suffering burn wounds. -KUTULLO MADISHA|kutullom@thenewage.co.za
