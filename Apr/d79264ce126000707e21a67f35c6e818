The DA said that Sars’ failure to meet its revised revenue target by more than R700 million confirms the death of institutional governance at Sars and low taxpayer morality under Tom Moyane’s disastrous term as a commissioner. Following Minister of Finance Nhlanhla Nene’s announcement that Sars had collected R1,216.6 trillion against a revised target of R1,217.3 the party said it shows the institute’s inability to effectively manage revenue collection. DA Shadow Deputy Minister of Finance Alf Lees MP said the government has no other option but to close the gap of the R700 million shortfall through increased borrowings as it is unlikely that there will be additional expenditure savings to counter the revenue shortage. “Minister Nene is faced with the urgent task of restoring sanity at SARS by ensuring that a permanent and effective Commissioner is appointed as a matter of urgency to clean up the mess left by Tom Moyane. “We must commend the acting SARS Commissioner Mark Kingon for trying to pull a rabbit out of the hat to achieve the revenue of R1, 217.3 trillion that was predicted in the 2017 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement.” -TNA Reporter
