The Correctional Services Department on Monday confirmed 16 detainees escaped from the Johannesburg Correctional Centre, also known as Sun City. The detainees reportedly managed to escape by breaking through a window, barricades and a wall around 3am on Monday morning. “We have launched a manhunt, working together with the SAPS and we will push to make sure that all 16 return,” the department’s Singabakho Nxumalo said. Nxumalo said identikits would soon be released by authorities. “We will be releasing their names and identities to the public and we urge the public to assist in reporting those but should not try to apprehend them.” -TNA Reporter
