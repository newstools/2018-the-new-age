Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema has said that land should not be viewed through a “Eurocentric legal perspective”. He said this during a land expropriation rally in George, Western Cape. Malema said that April 6 should be declared Land Day as this was the day when Europeans arrived on South African shores. “We came here and we lived in harmony with the Koi-San because we respected each other as human beings. We must change this because the majority of the people in this country, who are black, should be the ones who own land,” Malema said. Blaming unemployment and illiteracy on the dispossession of land, Malema said that the occupation of land was not illegal as the occupiers were taking what belonged to them. He said that white supremacists aren’t afraid of him, rather they were frightened at the possibility of equality. He said they were afraid of having domestic workers and gardeners on equal footing with them. “This is why we want you to own property because the people who are the owners of property treat you like subhumans and shoot at you, claiming they thought you were a baboon.” Malema further reiterated that the reason various voices proclaiming a white genocide is that these are a precursor to an invasion of SA like Iraq. “The reason why this invasion will be successful is that there is no alternative narrative to counter the lie that there is a white genocide happening in South Africa,” he said. Malema said that the next mother of the nation would come from the EFF and that land would return to its rightful owners. “The Land Report shows that 72% of the land is owned by the white minority, We must change this because the majority of the people in this country, who are black, should be the ones who own 72%,” he said. hlonim@thenewage.co.za
