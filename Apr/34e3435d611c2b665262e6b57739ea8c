VERY few people keep their promises like World Boxing Organisation bantamweight champion Zolani Tete. The 30 year old last week promised that he would dispatch Argentinian boxer Omar Andres Narvaez in style in Belfast – and he did just that. Tete won all 12 rounds in a one-sided affair against the experienced 42 year old in a mandatory title defence. The dull contest saw Tete walk away with a unanimous decision – all the judges scored him 120-108. Now in his sights is a unification bout with WBA bantamweight titleholder Ryan Burnett and it looks it will take something really big to stop that. The man from Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape last week challenged the Northern Ireland boxer, asking Burnett not to deny the world a great fight. “Let’s see who the real bantamweight king is. I want to unify the division and Burnett is standing in my way. Let’s not rob the public of a brilliant fight. They want to see the best fight the best,” Tete said. “Until that fight, I will do everything that is asked of me by my team. Narvaez is a mandatory defence and I’ll be aiming to dispatch him in style to make another statement. I can’t wait to put in another explosive performance for all of my new fans in Belfast,” Tete said before the fight with Narvaez. International promoter Frank Warren, who had put together the rights in Belfast this past Saturday, said he would bring Tete back to Ireland to fight Burnett. Tete, who is a southpaw, improved his record to 27-3, with 21 knock-outs. He has not lost a fight in six years, the last time in 2012 when Roberto Sosa caught him by surprise. That would go on to be one of just three defeats in his entire career. -MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
