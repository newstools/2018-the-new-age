Parliament has announced that it will proceed with disciplinary action against secretary Gengezi Mgidlana who is alleged to have spent about R4-million on questionable trips. In a statement, parliament says that it will pursue the actions against Mgidlana after the Western Cape High Court on Friday dismissed his attempt to interdict the disciplinary process against him. “Mgidlana is facing charges that relate to, inter alia, the alleged breach of the financial management of parliament and provincial legislatures Act, breach of parliamentary policies, as well as the National Road Traffic Act,’ reads Parliament statement. The secretary who is currently on suspicion is alleged to have spent almost R4-million of taxpayer money undertaking international and domestic trips in a period of two years. The Sunday Times is reporting that the trips included travels where he took his wife to funerals and fashion shows. This allegation was revealed in an investigative report by the parliament’s audit committee. Following this report, Mgidlana sought to interdict the disciplinary actions that parliament had initiated against him pending his request to have the report reviewed. The Parliament hearing that he intended to interdict was scheduled to sit between 9 to 20 April. His application was dismissed with costs. According to the report, Mgidlana also reportedly ordered parliamentary officials to drive him around in vehicles that were fitted with blue lights. The paper is also reporting that Mgidlana was also found to have acted irregularly when he hired an IT manager who is alleged to have no proper qualifications for the position. She is also alleged to have been offered an R265 000 bursary. -TNA Reporter
