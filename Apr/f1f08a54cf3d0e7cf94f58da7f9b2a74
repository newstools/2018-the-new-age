Transport Minister and SACP Secretary-General Blade Nzimande will deliver the keynote address at an event to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Chris Hani’s death. The commemoration will be held at Thomas Nkobi Memorial Park in Ekurhuleni. Hani was the leader of the SACP and chief of staff of uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the armed wing of the ANC. He was assassinated on 10 April 1993 outside his home in Dawn Park, Boksburg. Apartheid-era Conservative Party member Clive-Derby-Lewis and Polish immigrant Janusz Waluś were sentenced to life imprisonment for his death. Derby-Lewis died in 2016, after his release on parole. Waluś is currently serving a life sentence. Meanwhile, the University of Cape Town will commemorate Hani’s death by renaming one of its lecture theatres after him. The event will be attended by Hani’s family and SACP Deputy Secretary-General Jeremy Cronin. -TNA Reporter
