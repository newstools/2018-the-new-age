Late struggle veteran Winnie Madikizela-Mandela is to be buried at the same cemetery as her great-granddaughter, at the Fourways Memorial Park in Johannesburg, on Saturday. Madikizela-Mandela, who was offered a special official funeral by President Cyril Ramaphosa, will be buried at the same cemetery where her great-granddaughter Zenani Mandela was laid to rest in 2010. This was reportedly a request from the late struggle icon herself. Zenani died in 2010 in a car accident in the midst of the FIFA World Cup. The 13 year old was granddaughter to Madikizela-Mandela’s eldest child. Meanwhile, a memorial service in remembrance of Mama Winnie will be held in Soweto on Wednesday next week. On Wednesday, ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu, together with NCOP Chief Whip Seiso Mohai, will lead a delegation of the ANC parliamentary caucus to the home of the late ANC MP and stalwart. Madikizela-Mandela passed away at the Netcare Milpark Hospital on Monday following a long illness. While expressing his words of condolences to the family, ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule said that the family must find comfort in that the name of their daughter will forever be illuminated. “We remember her qualities as an activist and a leader and also her revolutionary discipline and commitment to the founding principles and values of the ANC. She lived and ended her life as a cadre of the ANC,” he said. -TNA Reporter
