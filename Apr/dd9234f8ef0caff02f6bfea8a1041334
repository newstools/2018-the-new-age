ANC Youth League (ANCYL) President Collen Maine says the current youth must have the guts to speak truth to power and be able to rise to the occasion and deal with the current issues. “Young people must be able to speak without fear and favour. We must be able to talk to the ANC government, there is no threat of death to us like Solomon Mahlangu.” The ANCYL president was speaking on the sidelines of the commemoration of Solomon Kalushi Mahlangu in Pretoria on Friday. Mahlangu was hanged on this day 6 April 1979 by the apartheid government at the age of 22 years. He was sentenced by the then Judge Ramon Leon. The country’s deputy president David Mabuza together with Mahlangu’s family visited the Gallows of the Kgosi Mampuru prison in Pretoria. Mabuza and family observed the re-enactment of Mahlangu’s moments prior to his execution. Mahlangu attended Mamelodi High School but left school in grade 10 when it was closed due to ongoing rioting in the area. He joined the ANC in September 1976 and left the country for Angola and then Mozambique, where he received his military training as an Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) cadre. He returned to South Africa on 11 June 1977, through Swaziland, heavily armed, to assist student protests. -Sipho Jack
