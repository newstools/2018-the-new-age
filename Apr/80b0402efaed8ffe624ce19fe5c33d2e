National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Shaun Abrahams has accused Afrikaans lobby group AfriForum of jumping the gun by announcing that they would seek to privately prosecute Economic Freedom Fighters(EFF) leader Julius Malema. Abrahams said he was surprised to learn of the lobby group’s intentions given that there was no communication between his office and AfriForum about the matter. The NDPP was in Parliament on Tuesday to deliver the National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA’s) annual performance plans and budget proposal for 2019. He accused Afriforum and its head of private of prosecutions Gerrie Nel of grandstanding by announcing its intentions before NPA exhausted all its process on the case against Malema. Last week, Nel announced that they would privately prosecute Malema for his involvement in On-Point Engineering, which is reportedly owned Malema’s Ratanang Family Trust, which was allegedly awarded multimillion-rand contracts by the Limpopo government. Without mentioning Afriforum by name, Abrahams said it was opportunistic for the lobby group to go public with its announcement. “… In fact, even before this NGO had gone public on this matter, I was expecting that the NPA may be ready to announce a decision” “I was surprised when this NGO announced they were ready for prosecution. It was unbecoming, to say the least.”Abrahams said. He said he has assigned the case to a new team of prosecutors who are currently busy looking at the case and are currently continuing with interviewing witnesses. -TNA Reporter
