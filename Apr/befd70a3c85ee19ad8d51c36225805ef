DA Parliamentary Chief Whip John Steenhuisen says that the argument on the proposed five-year term extension for party leader Mmusi Maimane has nothing to do limiting his leadership term. Steenhuisen said on Twitter in response to the reports that there was a division within the party over the proposed term extension. DA members have proposed for the Congress that is due to sit next weekend to amend the party’s constitution on the current party leaders term of office that is at three years to be extended to five. Steenhuisen says that “the argument is on the frequency of our congresses. “Isn’t it amazing that every other party can have a policy and constitutional debates and this is lauded by analysts as “healthy” and “robust” as soon as the DA does its cast as “division” and “splits” so tedious….,” he said. Those opposing the extension fear that it will make it difficult to hold Maimane accountable. Maimane is currently running for the position of party leader unopposed. This comes after another proposal is believed to be dividing the party. Last week, the party defended its move on tabled motion to amend the party’s constitution to include diversity as a value. This is also expected to be debated in the upcoming DA’s congress. This was reported to have further created race divisions within the party. However, Democratic Alliance MP and Shadow Communications Minister Phumzile Van Damme said that these were mere battle idea within the party. “It is a pity that this battle of ideas in the DA is racialised and black DA supporters painted as supportive of a specific policy viewpoint, and white supporters, another,” she said. -TNA Reporter
