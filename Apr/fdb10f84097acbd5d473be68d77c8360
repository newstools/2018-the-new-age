A R100 000 reward is being offered by the Hawks for information that could lead to the arrest and prosecution of Charles Ranyao, 41  and Stelio Rosario Mkize, 33. It is reported that the two are wanted for murder, attempted murder, possession of prohibited firearms, ammunition and GPS jamming devices. The suspects made a series of court appearances in the Alexandra Magistrate’s Court were their bail applications were denied. Captain Lloyd Ramovha said: “They however appealed to the Johannesburg High Court and were subsequently granted R25 000 bail each. The case was transferred to the High Court, Ranyao failed to show up for trial and on 3 October 2017, Mkize absconded.” He added that they were both found guilty in absentia. “Manzini was sentenced on 6 October 2017, to two terms of life imprisonment and an additional 66 years.” Ramovha emphasised that the wanted suspects are dangerous and habitual criminals who are likely to continue committing violent crimes for as long as they are on the loose. -TNA Reporter
