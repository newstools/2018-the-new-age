Black First Land First (BLF) will be back at the Western Cape High Court on Tuesday for an application interdicting unlawful land invasions of wine farms owned by businessman Johann Rupert. The interdict application which was lodged in an attempt to prevent BLF from the farms which are owned by Rupert was postponed in February earlier this year. The BLF will be represented in this matter by its President Andile Mngxitama. In a statement, the BLF says that the South African justice system is ‘racist’ and will not allow itself to be used to expropriate white landowners. “The interdicts applied for are aimed at arresting the land revolution led by BLF in Franschoek and in other areas regarding productive white-owned land. The movement is being stopped from expropriating land without compensation – land that is owned by Johann Rupert, whose interests lie in securing and perpetuating the benefits of the historical colonial theft of black lands. “To this end, Rupert is seeking white justice in the colonial courts to ensure BLF does not take back the stolen land he is occupying,” BLF said. The Rupert family initially applied for the interdict last year following allegations that the BLF had intentions to occupy the land. -TNA Reporter
