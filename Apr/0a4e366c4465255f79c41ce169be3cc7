The ANC has on Wednesday unveiled a jam-packed itinerary of events as it bids farewell to one of its most beloved members umam’ uWinnie Madikizela-Mandela. Secretary-General Ace Magashule while briefing the media at the party’s Luthuli House headquarters said that the party would do all it can to ensure that the anti-apartheid struggle stalwart received a send-off which is befitting of her. “The programme has been discussed in detail with the Madikizela-Mandela family to ensure they support it and participate in it,” Magashule said. The programme kicked off in earnest earlier today when Deputy President David Mabuza, accompanied by ANC Treasurer Paul Mashatile visited Madikizela-Mandela’s home in Soweto. Their visit was followed by that of the ANC parliamentary caucus led by Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu. The programme is scheduled to crisscross throughout out the country as ANC leaders pay tribute to umam’ uWinnie. #Magashule DAY TWO (Thursday, 5th April 2018) #WinnieMandela pic.twitter.com/GjMwQFcKna — African National Congress (@MYANC) April 4, 2018 #Magashule DAY THREE (Friday, 06 April 2018) #WinnieMandela pic.twitter.com/Ki5fMoj71w — African National Congress (@MYANC) April 4, 2018 #Magashule DAY FOUR (Saturday, 7 April 2018) pic.twitter.com/PF3gw0iJ8w — African National Congress (@MYANC) April 4, 2018 #Magashule DAY FIVE (Sunday, 8 April 2018) pic.twitter.com/rxLWiik89D — African National Congress (@MYANC) April 4, 2018 #Magashule DAY SIX (Monday, 9 April 2018) pic.twitter.com/wwuAzrgjR1 — African National Congress (@MYANC) April 4, 2018 #Magashule DAY SEVEN (Tuesday, 10 April 2018) #WinnieMandela pic.twitter.com/v8EYMT28Tt — African National Congress (@MYANC) April 4, 2018 #Magashule DAY EIGHT (Wednesday, 11 April 2018) #WinnieMandela pic.twitter.com/u4OLRlQ5VV — African National Congress (@MYANC) April 4, 2018 #Magashule DAY NINE (Friday, 13 April 2018) #WinnieMandela pic.twitter.com/Hlxv9roLb7 — African National Congress (@MYANC) April 4, 2018 #Magashule DAY TEN (Saturday, 14 April 2018) #WinnieMandela pic.twitter.com/T9MmVUGjRw — African National Congress (@MYANC) April 4, 2018 President Cyril Ramaphosa yesterday announced that the late struggle veteran will be honoured with a special official funeral Category 1 which entails elements of military ceremonial honours.
