The South African Government has called upon conveners of the National strike to ensure that chaos does not ensue around Parliament, as it is a national key point. The government said peaceful protests were quintessentially a characteristic of a strengthened democratic and progressive society. “The right to assemble and to protest in order to advance a particular cause is enshrined in the SA Constitution. Marches played a central role during the apartheid era and culminated into the transition from apartheid to democracy. Today, marches continue to play a role in the democratic SA society,” The South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) on Wednesday has called on its affiliates to embark on a national shutdown over the proposed National Minimum Wage (NMW) by the government. Protestors are expected to assemble in Newtown, Johannesburg ahead of the march. The march will move from Newtown to the provincial labour and health departments and will end at the Premier’s office in the Joburg CBD. Members of African National Congress (ANC) and Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) were seen among marchers. On Tuesday the union confirmed that it will forge ahead with the nationwide planned strike. “We are forging ahead with the mass mobilisation of workers on the 25th. A nationwide general strike and marches throughout the country, to protest against the proposed poverty-level NMW of R20 an hour and amendments Labour laws to labour laws which will destroy workers constitutional right to strike,” said Saftu. -TNA Reporter
