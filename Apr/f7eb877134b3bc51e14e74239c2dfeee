BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt insists he is not concerned about playing Orlando Pirates behind closed doors tomorrow in their Absa Premiership encounter at Orlando Stadium. Pirates and Wits will play their fixture in an empty stadium after the Premier Soccer League disciplinary hearing sanctioned the Buccaneers to play one of their home fixtures without spectators after they were found guilty over their fans’ behaviour last year February in their 6-0 defeat by Mamelodi Sundowns. Hunt said he accepted the outcome and that teams should be punished for their fans’ behaviour and he linked this to Kaizer Chiefs supporters also invading the pitch following their defeat to Free State Stars in the Nedbank Cup semifinal at Moses Mabhida Stadium at the weekend. “It is unacceptable, we are going back to my time while playing football in the ’80s. I mean the poor guy (security guard) was kicked in the face while on the ground. The guy ran up and kicked him in the face, how can anyone do that?” Hunt was left disappointed with his side following their 1-1 draw at home against Polokwane City at Milpark Stadium where they equalised right at the death through Vincent Pule. “That’s the story of our season I’m disappointed with the players. I have backed them all the time but now you can’t back them with that performance.” The result left the Clever Boys still short of a spot in the top eight with three matches remaining and one point behind eighth placed Bloemfontein Celtic. “There’s nine points still to play for, anything is achievable in football if you want it badly you can achieve it and it is about how much you want it but we will see.” -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
