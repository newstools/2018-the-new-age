The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has called on Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to investigate former President Jacob Zuma and North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo following allegations that Mahumapelo gave Zuma a herd of cattle worth R1.5-million as a gift. The party says that it has written to Mkhwebane on the matter. “Both Mahumapelo and Zuma must be investigated and if found guilty they must not only pay back the money, they must be criminally held liable for abuse of state funds. It is not possible that Zuma can claim that he wrongly benefited from state money without any knowledge as it was the case with the Nkadla homestead security upgrades,” said an EFF  statement. The Sunday Times reported that this gift to Zuma was allegedly paid for with public funds and that the herd of cattle was allegedly meant for emerging farmers in the NW province. The matter is also reported to be under investigation by the Hawks. The EFF says that ‘this time’ Mkhwebane must not only recover public funds but must also charge relevant law enforcement agencies to prosecute Zuma and Mahumapelo for allegedly stealing the cattle. Mahumapelo has come under fire to resign as Premier after being accused of corrupt related to the Gupta family as well as being linked to a number of other corruption scandals. Meanwhile residents in Mafikeng took to the streets and burnt a bus, barricaded roads demanding for the resignation of Mahumapelo this past week. The EFF has added to the chorus calling for Mahumapelo to step down as Premier of North West. “Mahumapelo has not only failed to drive the state machinery to deliver services, he has been part of crippling corruption,” said EFF -TNA Reporter
