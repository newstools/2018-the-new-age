Johannesburg Metro Police Department spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar on Thursday warned motorists who will be attending the funeral of Mother of the Nation, Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela on Saturday to avoid roads around Orlando Stadium in Soweto. Madikizela-Mandela will be laid to rest at Fourways Memorial Park in Johannesburg, as the country continues to mourn and celebrate her life. It is reported that Mooki Street will be blocked off between the Soweto Highway and Sofasonke Street and Klipspruitvalley Road will be closed between the N17 circle and Khumalo Street. “At about 12 pm, the funeral procession will leave Orlando Stadium and join the N1 north freeway. Officers will be deployed around the route to direct traffic,” Minnaar said. On Wednesday, thousands of people gathered at Orlando Stadium in Soweto to commemorate the life of struggle icon, Madikizela-Mandela. Those who eulogised Madikizela-Mandela described her as an idol who remained in the struggle for the poor and downtrodden until her dying day. On top of several informal settlements named after her, she remained a resident of Soweto despite most of her family living in the suburbs. “Mourners will not be allowed to drive through cordoned off areas and will have to park at Nasrec. They will then be ferried by buses to the stadium.” He added that the roads would be reopened at 6pm. -TNA Reporter
