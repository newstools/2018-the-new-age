Orlando Pirates kept their title hope alive following a 2-1 win over Amazulu on Sunday afternoon at the King Zwelithini Stadium. The home side took the lead early in the game when Mabhuti Khenyeza scored from a close range following a cross from Ovidy Karuru. Amazulu almost doubled their lead in the 24th minute when Milton Ncube’s short hit the side-netting from a close range. The Buccaneers secured an equaliser in the 33rd minute when Musa Nyatama scored a header from Thembinkosi Lorch’s free-kick. Both sides came to second half looking for a lead but could not get one early. With pressure mounting on Pirates’ bench, coach Milutin Sredojevic had to bring on Thabo Qalinge for  Mpho Makola on the hour mark. The Buccaneers grabbed their second goal in the 80th minute through Qalinge. The Soweto giants remained resolute at the back despite Amazulu throwing numbers forward. The win sees Pirates close the gap between them and Sundowns  from six points to three points. Sundowns will be in action on Tuesday when play host to Golden Arrows at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium. -TNA Reporter
