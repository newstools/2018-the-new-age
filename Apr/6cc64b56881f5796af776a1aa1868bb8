Former head of state Jacob Zuma, has questioned government’s timing with regard to the introduction free higher education. Speaking during a lecture in Umlazi in KwaZulu-Natal last night, Zuma said by the time he took a decision to introduce fee-free higher education in December last year; it was a decision already three years behind schedule. “Why did we take over 20 years before we implemented free higher education.Free education had been guaranteed in the Freedom Charter decades earlier,” he said. He also took a swipe at Heher Commission which conducted a survey on whether free higher education can be realised by the government. During the African National Congress (ANC) conference, Zuma announced the immediate implementation of free higher education for poor and working-class South African youth as part of Government’s Radical Socio-Economic Transformation. At the time, he said free education and training will be extended to all current and future poor and working class South African students at all public TVET colleges starting in 2018 and phased-in over a period of five years. “The intervention will enable the government to extend fully subsidised free higher education to youth from well over 90% of South African households. “All poor and working class South African students enrolled at public TVET Colleges will be funded through grants, not loans.” President Zuma added that the first year students who have a maximum combined family income of R350 000 per annum will be able to apply for NSFAS, an increase from the original R122 000 family income per annum cap. -TNA Reporter
