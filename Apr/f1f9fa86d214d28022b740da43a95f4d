THE bitter battle between former referee Andile “Ace” Ncobo and the South African Football Association, with Danny Jordaan his main target, does not look close to closure. May 12 might be circled for the Safa congress and the elections to take place but Ncobo has once more reiterated that Jordaan will not be allowed to stand as president for a second term. While everyone might have thought that Ncobo would rejoice at former ANC MP Jennifer Ferguson pressing rape charges against Jordaan for an offence she claims happened in 1994, Ncobo said he had never spoken to the woman she referred to as her “ANC comrade”. In turn, Ncobo said his main issue at the moment was with Safa allegedly operating without an auditing firm. “We are sitting here with a football association that is in breach of the Companies Act. “No registered entity is supposed to stand a single day without an auditing firm,” Ncobo said. “KPMG terminated its contract with Safa, with the legacy trust and with the development agency on March 3.” -MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
