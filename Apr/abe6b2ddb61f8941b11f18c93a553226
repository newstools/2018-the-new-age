Lieutenant-Colonel Katlego Mogale said: “owners of pets have also advised that the loud bangs are likely to severely agitate animals and therefore special provisions should be made for them for the duration of the funeral ceremony.” Meanwhile, people from all walks of the country gathered at the Orlando Stadium in Soweto on Wednesday to pay their respects to the struggle icon. On Tuesday, President Cyril Ramaphosa was among those who paid homage to Madikizela-Mandela at a memorial service in Bizana where the fiery struggle heroine was born. Ramaphosa visited the Madikizela-Mandela homestead in Mbongweni village to comfort the family before going to the memorial service. “I am happy to meet the big family of Madikizela. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela believed that freedom would have to be fought for and achieved and indeed she fought. She truly hated the demon of corruption, state corruption and state capture. She will have a special place in our hearts because of her strength and courage,” Ramaphosa said. Ramaphosa also paid tribute to Chris Hani, Solomon Mahlangu and the late ANC president OR Tambo who he said had all “fought for the democracy we have today”. “She was always on the side of the youth and this is the relationship that earned her the title of Mother of the Nation. She never betrayed the struggle because of fear of pain, hardship and punishment by the apartheid government.” -TNA Reporter
