The DA in Gauteng on Sunday said the provincial health department needed to explain why doctors in the province were receiving incomplete salaries. DA shadow health MEC Jack Bloom said he had received reports that the provincial government had not been giving doctors in the province their overtime pay, at several hospitals. According to Bloom, doctors at the Tembisa, Leratong and Yusuf Dadoo hospitals – and at other hospitals – had not received the money they’d worked for. “This comes on top of a freeze on new medical appointments, that are hindering the ability of hospitals to provide quality healthcare,” Bloom said. Bloom said some doctors at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, who also received incomplete salaries this month, were told that it was an administrative issue that would be sorted out. He said the head of the Gauteng department of e-government, Boy Ngobeni, previously confirmed in a letter that the department had given instructions not to pay overtime to medical professionals. -TNA Reporter
