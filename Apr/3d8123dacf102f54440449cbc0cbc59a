Gauteng MEC of Education Panyaza Lesufi has vowed to open a case against a group of people who have been racially threatening him and his family. Lesufi told Talk Radio 702 that the threats against him and his family have been going on for a long time and that he has now decided to put extra measures to ensure his family’s safety. This comes after two white men hang an effigy in front of the Department of Basic Education in Pretoria on Wednesday dressed in ANC colours with Lesufi’s face and a poster accusing him of raping Afrikaans in a protest against the department’s language policy. Gauteng ANC also criticised the protest and called on Lesufi to register a case with the police and the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) against the people who paraded Lesufi in protest against the department’s language policy. The ANC said the hanging seeks to undermine efforts to build a non-racial society through the transformation of the country’s basic education system as led by Lesufi. “This brazen act by anti-transformation agents flies in the face of the supremacy of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa which advocates for equality and the advancement of human rights and freedoms including non-racialism.” The party said it was clear the three-year sentence handed to a convicted racist Vickie Momberg has not deterred some South Africans from being racist towards anyone. “What is very clear from this latest incident is that the recent judgment meted out to convicted racist, Vicki Momberg, which sets a precedent for other racial related cases, has not had the desired effect as some still feel the need to defend their apartheid racial legacy.” -TNA Reporter
