The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) Council to collaborate with the Department of Higher Education and Training to stamp out corruption at its residences. This comes after the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee visited the Cape Peninsula University on Wednesday where the acting Vice-Chancellor Dr Chris Nhlapo revealed to it that “the residence system is riddled with corruption from top to bottom”. The committee met with the university’s management and the Student Representative Council for a briefing with regard to transformation, staff shortages and student accommodation matters at the institution. The DA says that the acting Vice-Chancellor also said to them that “people with substantial vested interests in the corrupt system of “selling” rooms, gaining access to SRC funds for frequent parties and other alleged kinds of corruption were prepared to resort to violence to
protect their turf. Both staff and students are allegedly involved in this corruption,” said DA Shadow Minister of Higher Education and Training Belinda Bozzoli in a statement.  The committee conducted the visit following a failure by the University’s council to attend a scheduled meeting with it that was scheduled for last week. “The presence of corruption in university residences needs urgent forensic investigation at CPUT and other universities. The DA is determined to uncover these practices, and will fight to bring them to an end,” said the DA The party says that though it welcomes Dr Nhlapo’s commitment to ending the corrupt system at the institution, this requires a “nationwide, multi-pronged approach”
