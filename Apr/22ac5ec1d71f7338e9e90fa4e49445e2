JUSTICE and Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha, and former president Nelson Mandela’s wife Graça Machel yesterday unveiled the Massive Mandela Masterpiece blanket at the Zonderwater Correctional Centre. The 7000m² portrait is large enough to be seen from outer space. Masutha says the blanket is a metaphorical expression of the many chapters of the biography of the country, straddling over the last century to date and into the future. “As a collage made up of blankets from across the globe, it is a tribute to the invaluable acts of international solidarity in our struggle for freedom, with Nelson Mandela as one of the leading figures in that struggle,” he said. The unveiling of the blanket was part of a series of events in the country to celebrate the centenary of Mandela and the late anti-apartheid activist, Albertina Sisulu. The theme of the year’s celebrations: Be The Legacy, is meant to encourage South Africans to reflect on the values and principles that guided the Mandela generation and to think of ways to address the triple challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment in the country. The massive blanket was made by inmates. “The individual blankets will be distributed to communities in need throughout the country during the forthcoming winter. “In this connection, the blanket portrait is a metaphor for the humane and people-centred values of ubuntu, which guided the Mandela generation during the decades struggle,” Masutha said. He also thanked Carolyn Steyn, the founder of 67 Blankets for Nelson Mandela Day. “The journey we have travelled is but a mere four years. Nevertheless, its impact has reached areas and people that we never imagined,” he said. Machel thanked all those who participated in the 67 Blankets project, especially the inmates at the Zonderwater Correctional Facility. “You do not need to be in a high position to make a difference in someone’s life,” she said. kutullom@thenewage.co.za
