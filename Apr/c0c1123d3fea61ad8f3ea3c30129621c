Nine people were arrested in four separate places on Wednesday for public violence following protest action. The arrest of the suspects, aged between 28 and 36, followed an incident where members of the community in Ga-Manyaka village went on a rampage and barricaded the main road to Marula Mine. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba has called upon all members of the community to keep calm and to raise their concerns peacefully without any form of disruption and violence. Meanwhile, a group of community members also embarked on protest action where they barricaded the inner roads and later went to barricade the R81 road along Polokwane and Giyani near Mooketsi. During the protests tyres were burnt on the tarred road causing serious public disturbance including the disruption of schools and traffic flow. -TNA Reporter
