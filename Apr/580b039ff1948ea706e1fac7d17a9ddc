Today we officially open the DA’s new Campaign Headquarters in the heart of Gauteng as we intensify the battle for victory in this province ahead of next year’s general elections, DA leader Mmusi Maimane said. Maimane was addressing a crowd on Wednesday in Bruma, Johannesburg as the party was officially opening ‘Nkululeko House’ also known as ‘Freedom House’. He said the building will serve as political and operational headquarters of the DA leading to the 2019 elections and beyond. “Nkululeko House will be the party’s Campaign HQ and home to a large contingent of the DA’s federal staff structures including the National Campaign ‘war room’, the Polling and Research Department, national Call Centre, the Leader’s Office, Gauteng Provincial Office, and the party’s Corporate Services Directorate.” Maimane said that the party wants to grow its support base in the province as it strives to become a coalition government that will take over from the ANC in the national government. “The opening of Nkululeko House signals our intention loud and clear, both its name and its location speak to the DA’s vision for the future. We plan to govern this province come 2019, and we plan to grow our support base in every other province across the country.” Since the formation of the party in 2000, its Federation Head Office has been in Cape Town where it enjoys considerable support. -TNA Reporter
