Minister of Home Affairs, Malusi Gigaba visited Home Affairs offices around KZN  on Monday as part of the campaign to eliminate long queues and long waiting periods. Gigaba visited branches in Pietermaritzburg and Umngeni. The campaign was launched on Sunday after an assessment report that Gigaba had directed the Department to prepare. Amongst other things that the report found poor management in some offices, ineffective utilization of staff as among the root causes of long queues at offices. Gigaba said that in some of the offices that he visited, he discovered that it was not the volume of the people going to the offices that caused the long queues. “In many instances, the problem is just bad management on the ground,” he said. He said that the department would be taking a ‘brutal’ step in overseeing performance management of Home Affairs employees. The department is also due to pilot a one-stop workstation that will take fingerprints and photographs which will help to reduce the long periods spent by clients at Home Affairs offices.
