The South African Football Association (SAFA) has appointed its Vice-President Xolile Nkompela as the Acting President until such time that  Danny Jordan will be able to resume his duties. The football association says that the SAFA president is currently outside the country attending a CAF matter. “Dr Jordaan is out of the country and currently attending a CAF engagement in Madagascar where the entire CAF Executive Committee is meeting together with the continent’s FA Presidents. Also in Madagascar is world football governing body, FIFA secretary general Fatma Samoura. Mr Nkompela will be Acting President until such time that the President is able to resume his duties” reads the SAFA statement. A case of rape was recently opened against the Safa boss by singer and former ANC MP Jennifer Ferguson. Ferguson is accusing Jordaan to have sexually assaulted her about 24 years ago in a hotel in Johannesburg. Jordan has denied these allegations levelled against him. TNA Reporter
