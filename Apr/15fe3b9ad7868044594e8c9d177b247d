EFF leader Julius Malema has called for the Cape Town International Airport to be renamed in honour of Mama Winnie Madikizela Mandela. “If it is true that the ANC wants to honour you, let them name Cape Town Airport after Winnie Mandela.” Malema also used the platform at Winnie Madikizela Mandela’s funeral to attack her detractors. Malema made reference particularly to the United Democratic Front (UDF), saying that they did not want her during the dark days of the country but today they are singing a different tune. “Mama the UDF cabal is here, they called a press conference and rejected you at the time the regime was prepared to kill. We see you in your beautiful suits, sellouts,” Malema said. The EFF leader said Madikizela Mandela never sold out, despite being disowned by her organisation (ANC). He pledged to celebrate Winnie Mandela’s life forever, adding that he attended the funeral because he wanted to invoke her spirit. “I’m here to invoke the spirit of the one who put the country first. Mama died a perfect death and never sold out; you were persecuted by Apartheid and disowned by your party.” At Winnie’s 80th birthday, Winnie urged ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa and Malema to mend their relationship and had asked the EFF leadership to return to the ANC. She also promised to facilitate a meeting between the Marikana widows and Ramaphosa in order to allow him to ask for forgiveness to them. Mama Madikizela’s funeral is attended by foreign dignitaries such as former Kenya prime minister Oraila Odinga and her close friend Mrs Mokgobo, former South African presidents Mbeki, Motlanthe, and Zuma. -TNA Reporter
