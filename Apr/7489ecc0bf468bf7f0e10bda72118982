Two suspects who were arrested for public violence and malicious damage to property after Kaizer Chiefs lost 2-0 to Free State Stars at Moses Mabhida Stadium will appear in the Durban Magistrates Court on Monday. The spectators thrashed television equipment, beat up security guards, and also set the seats of the stadium on fire. The fans were angry with former coach Steve Komphela who has failed to bring success to the Soweto club. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Nqobile Gwala said, “Two suspects were arrested aged 27 and 33 for public violence as well as malicious damage to property.” Gwala said that the police had deployed enough personnel to the stadium but the angry soccer fans just ‘stormed’ into the field. Police were forced to use stun grenades to disperse the unruly crowds. She said that there were a number of people who sustained injuries during the incident but could not confirm the exact number. She could also not confirm the reports that a security guard had died following the incidence but said that investigations on the matter were underway. -TNA Reporter
