A 34-year-old man has been arrested after he hijacked a vehicle owned by a victim he befriended through the internet. It is believed that the victim had invited the suspect to his house in Queenswood, east of Pretoria, on Friday night, where following a night of drinking, he offered to transport the suspect during the early hours of Saturday morning. Captain Daniel Mavimbela said: “About halfway into that trip, the suspect and an accomplice attacked the victim with a sharp object before driving away with his Hyundai T20.” “The suspect was caught at a hospital in Mamelodi, east of Pretoria while receiving medical attention after the vehicle had crashed in the same area.” The victim has since been treated and released from a local hospital for injuries he had suffered during the alleged hijacking. Sunnyside police have warned the public to act with absolute caution before the meeting or even entertaining strangers who befriend them via the internet. -TNA Reporter
