North West premier Supra Mahumapelo says people are gunning for his son because of their hatred for him. Mahumapelo has pleaded with people to stop harassing his child and should rather deal with him directly. “If they want a challenge they should confront me directly, I will deal with them because I have dealt with such things before,” he said. Mahumapelo’s comments come after reports that his son received an R1.1-million bursary to become a pilot. According to reports Supra Mahumapelo Junior was awarded the bursary without following proper procedures. The reports further alleged that the current Denel CEO Zwelakhe Ntshepe personally signed the contract which authorised the bursary. However, the North West premier has dismissed the reports saying his son applied for the bursary like any other child. “There are five children who are black who got the same bursary as my son. I don’t work for Denel and I also don’t approve bursaries,” Mahumapelo said. On Tuesday Denel issued a statement setting the record straight saying that there was no flouting of procedures. The company said bursaries were awarded to three students‚ of which Oarabile Mahumapelo was one‚ based on the same criteria. “The award was made in compliance with Denel’s relevant policy after a full disclosure and presentation to the board of directors of Denel which was noted without any objection‚” Denel said in a statement. -TNA Reporter
