SAGARMATHA Technologies, which describes itself as an integrated multisided platform technology group, is due to list on the main board of the JSE in the next two weeks, the company said yesterday. It will be listed in the media sector subsector of broadcast and entertainment. Businessman Iqbal Surve, through family trusts, will be the controlling shareholder of the new multibillion-rand listed entity, according to reports. Sagarmatha said its shareholders include eminent international investors such as Quantum Fund co-founder Jim Rogers and Harold Doley Jnr, who has been a member of the New York Stock Exchange for 34 years, along with trade unions and a number of strategic partners such as British Telecoms, Coriant, Nokia, Saab Grintek Technologies and Siemens. “The company has identified strategic points for citizen growth and knowledge empowerment in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution as it rolls out across Africa. “Sagarmatha is one of a few global technology groups with an integrated value proposition of platforms, e-commerce, content and distribution, enabled for prime customer monetisation in the context of this burgeoning digital inclusion. “With its comprehensive offerings and already established presence across the continent, Sagarmatha is firm in its belief that it has the potential to become the leader in e-commerce, digital media, syndicated content and technology ventures in Africa,” the company said. The listing is contingent on raising a minimum amount of R3bn. In order to provide Sagarmatha with additional capital to fund its further expansion, the company will, in conjunction with the listing, undertake a private placement involving an offer to invited investors to subscribe for up to 189 298 334 ordinary no par value shares in the company (private placement shares), at R39.62 a share, thereby raising R7.5bn. Sagarmatha said it is active in more than 40 African countries. – 701068 -TNA REPORTER
