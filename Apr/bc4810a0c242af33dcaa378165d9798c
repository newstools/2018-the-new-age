The ANC in Gauteng has accused Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba of ‘overlooking’ corruption taking place at the Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) in an attempt to maintain DA’s relations with one of its coalition partners, Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). In a statement issued by City of Johannesburg ANC Caucus, the Roads Agency which falls under the department of transport is alleged to be “currently under the control of the DA’s coalition partner, the IFP”. According to ANC, the city management is said to have found ‘gaps’ in the performance of a company that was contracted to build a double-decker bridge in the City, worth R91 million. “The company missed the deadline, managing to only complete 17% of the work. Executives managing the projects sought to terminate the said contracts but encountered resistance from the Board Chairperson, IFP’s Sibusiso Tshabalala, who denied the cancellation of the contract despite non-performance. Despite the failure to complete the contract on time, the company was rewarded with R14 million by the City.” The chairperson is alleged to be receiving protection from Mashaba. In a report by Amabhungane, allegations are reported to have come light last year following the departure of three officials who are alleged to have left the agency after a fallout with Tshabalala. The officials are alleged to have left after Tshabalala pushed for the establishment of a unit which would have taken control of tenders away from the Road agency. However, in a statement, the Joburg said that: “The Departure of senior officials for the JRA is not caused for concern in the manner that was portrayed. Our approach has been to work with those that are willing and committed, and there are many of such people. “Those who elect not to work with us are free to leave.” -TNA Reporter
