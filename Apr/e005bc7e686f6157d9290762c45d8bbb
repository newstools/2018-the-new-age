The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the North West will on Tuesday visit the Tshepong Hospital amidst the health workers strike in the province. Health workers affiliated to the National Education Health and Allied Workers’ Union (NEHAWU) in the province have been on a strike for over a month. The strike has since paralysed the department in some areas which have led to the army being deployed to the province to assist. Other hospitals have been reported to have no medication supply due to the strike. Speaking to the SABC, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said that the lack of medication was due to a closure of a depot in the area. “The depot was closed, the strike has affected the depo, they were not allowing the medicine to get out of the depot. There is only one depot that supplies all the 22 hospitals in the NW province,” he said. Motsoaledi said that they have requested the army to assist as a temporary measure while the department finds a solution with the workers. “We will definitely meet the unions in the province and try to negotiate.” He also cautioned the striking workers not to ‘punish’ the patients because they were not guilty in any way. He said that nurses or doctors were not on strike as far as he knows but they got intimidated and turned away. The strike has come in conjunction with the protests against North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo. Residents are calling for him to step down. -TNA Reporter
