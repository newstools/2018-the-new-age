The DA has said it plans to lay criminal charges against former Free State premier and ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule. The party said that this was in relation to the Vogelfontein Housing Development in which it is alleged that Magashule helped his daughter and a Chinese company secure an R150m housing contract. “Further allegations are that tender procurement processes were floated to ensure that Unital (the Chinese company) was paid nearly R70m by the provincial human settlements department to oversee the project,” the DA said. The party is said to conduct an oversight visit to the housing development then go to the Bethlehem police station and proceed with laying charges against Magashule on Monday. The DA had initially asked the public protector, advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, to investigate. The party said that upon conducting its own investigation it had uncovered that the houses were in poor condition with residents having no access to electricity, water or proper toilets. Standing outside the late political icon Winnie Madikizela’s house last week Magashule told journalists he was in communication with the family. “You can’t expect us to tell you about our meetings with the family. There was no wrongdoing on our part. Members of the press should not look for a scoop, we appeal to them to not try and harm Mama’s memory.” hlonim@thenewage.co.za
