The DA has cautiously welcomed the appointment of a new interim board at Denel. The appointment, which was announced by Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan on Monday, is subject to approval by Cabinet. Gordhan appointed former SAA board chairperson and ANC veteran Cheryl Carolus,  former chair of the South African Aerospace Maritime and Defence Industries Association Zoli Kunene, Sue Rabkin, who was a special advisor to former Defence Minister Mosiuoa Lekota, Current University of Johannesburg Vice-chancellor and principal Professor Tshilidzi Marwala, former SANDF chief of human resources and joint operations Themba Matanzima, Respected South African Businesswoman Gloria Serobe. He also appointed former Airports Company South Africa CEO Monhla Hlahla as the parastatal’s interim CEO. The DA said it, however, found it unhelpful that Gordhan chose to retain some individuals who served on the previous board which plunged the state arms manufacture into a financial quackmire. DA Shadow Minister of Public Enterprises Natasha Mazzone said Denel’s previous board and management still needed to account before the commission of inquiry into state capture, headed by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, which will start its investigation later this year. Mazzone said South Africans needed a full account of the circumstances that saw the Gupta brothers gain undue influence on some of the company’s high-level business decisions. “Denel had fallen prey to gross mismanagement and a carefully orchestrated plan of ‘state capture’ that saw the state armaments company fail to pay its employees and suppliers, forcing the government to shore it up with a R580 million guarantee.” Mazzone said the new interim board now has to ensure that it extricates the parastatal from undue political influence, as this was an essential first step in restoring its tattered corporate image. -TNA Reporter
