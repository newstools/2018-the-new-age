Five suspects have been remanded in custody after they were arrested by the Hawks for allegedly staging a cash heist in Kensington, Johannesburg. Nkosinathi Feni (48), Gabriel Mbhango (35), Siphiwe Hlungwane (45), Bavuyise Ndaba (30), and Petros Ndlovu (38) appeared at the Johannesburg Magistrates court on Friday for allegedly stealing millions of rands in foreign currency. Hawks spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mulamu said the investigating body’s National Bureau of Illegal Firearms Control and Priority Violence Crime (NBIFCPVC) unit carried out an investigation which led to the arrest in several parts of the country including Bloemfontein, Norkerm Park, Rustenburg, and Nongoma respectively. This is after money totaling R30 million which was being transported to Brinks Finance Solution was stolen. Mulamu said on Friday, April 13, an armoured cash vehicle escorted by a sedan left the depot in Spartan to deliver the cash in Selby near Johannesburg when it was allegedly ‘attacked’. She said the vehicles suddenly stopped near Kensington where they opened the armoured vehicle’s door and took off with bags of money before driving away. “The guards then drove away to alert their employer about the ‘robbery’ a few kilometres away from the scene.” Molamu said however before they arrived at their depot, they then drank a liquid which was spiked with an unknown substance. “They were subsequently found unconscious and taken to nearby hospital for treatment where it was established that they apparently drank soft drinks spiked with an unknown substance.” Molamu said they are working around the clock to locate four other suspects, including the armoured vehicle’s driver. The suspects will appear again on Monday, 30 April. -TNA Reporter
