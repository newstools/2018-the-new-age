THE Organisation for Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) have intervened in the SABC’s case against former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. The organisation said Motsoeneng was not paying back enough money from his pension to cover the costs he owed to the public broadcaster. Yesterday, Motsoeneng told The New Age he did not want to comment on the involvement of Outa in the process. “My lawyers are dealing with the matter. I would not like to talk about this at the moment, the matter is in court,” he said. The civil society organisation has applied to the Johannesburg High Court as friends of the court in the case. The broadcaster’s board brought a civil action case against the SABC pension fund and Motsoeneng. The board is claiming more than R11m from Motsoeneng’s pension. Outa’s head of legal affairs Stefanie Fick said the SABC’s claim did not go far enough and the public protector’s 2014 report, When Governance and Ethics Fail, should not be ignored. “The SABC said the fully computed claims against Motsoeneng, arising from these unlawful actions amount to in excess of R10m. The SABC also has an alternative claim against him of in excess of R11.5m, based on a ‘success fee’ paid to Motsoeneng,” Fick said. Outa said Motsoeneng should repay salary increases he received and pay for the posts he occupied since 1995, based on the qualifications he presented. Outa’s portfolio manager for special projects, Dominique Msibi said: “Hlaudi Motsoeneng compromised the SABC in many ways. He made deals costing the SABC millions of rands, like pocketing more than R10m in success fees.” hlonim@thenewage.co.za -HLONI MASHIGO
