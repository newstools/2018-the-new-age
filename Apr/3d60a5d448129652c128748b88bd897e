EFF national spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi on Sunday rubbished reports the party is reportedly in talks with the ANC to form an alliance. According to reports this is alleged to have been a “dying wish” of the late Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela who was buried on Saturday. The Sunday Times is reporting that following the death of Mama Winnie, leaders from the two parties have allegedly engaged in discussions for a possible coalition. EFF leader Julius Malema is reported to have spoken to President Cyril Ramaphosa about the matter. However, Ndlozi has rejected these claims. The reports that EFF is on talks with ANC about possible coalition are utter rubbish to say the least. Mama Winnie‘s last words on the matter of CIC Malema returning to ANC was that after having seen what we did in parliament, she now understands that EFF must exists! #Asijiki https://t.co/kCF7i3vjcY — #RegisterToVoteEFF (@MbuyiseniNdlozi) April 15, 2018  Before her death, Madikizela-Mandela had on several occasions expressed her wish for Malema to return to the ANC. However, Malema had also expressed that he would not return to the ANC. On Saturday, ANC Election Chair Fikile Mbalula said the party would continue persuading members of the EFF to return to the ANC. Addressing the issue while paying his tribute to Madikizela-Mandela, Malema questioned “which ANC” members were to return to. “Mama, you said to us we must come back to the ANC, we heard you. But which ANC do we go to? Of the same people who sold you out? Of the same people who were ready to give you the enemy?” Malema said. -TNA Reporter
