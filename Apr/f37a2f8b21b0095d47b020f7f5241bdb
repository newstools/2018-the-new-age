A NEW scandal threatens to engulf audit firm KPMG – this time involving VBS Mutual Bank. Chartered accountant Sipho Malaba, who was the lead independent audit partner on the bank, has been suspended after being accused of severe mismanagement and fraudulent dealings with senior executives of VBS. VBS was put under the curatorship last month by the Reserve Bank. KPMG is still reeling from a corruption scandal which resulted in nine executives, including the CEO, resigning. It is alleged that VBS was unable to account for almost R1bn that went missing under KPMG’s watch. In response to The New Age, KPMG SA said was investigating and offering full cooperation to the curator of VBS. “We cannot tolerate any behaviour which places our people, our clients or the public at large, at risk. “It goes without saying that this news is an enormous disappointment. We have worked hard, and are well aware that we have more to do. “As the investigation is ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment further,” the auditing firm said. Recently, KPMG South Africa appointed Wiseman Nkuhlu as its chairperson. Pressure group the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) welcomed the decision by KPMG to suspend Malaba as the head of its largest business unit. “The new executive committee at KPMG is showing positive signs. “It is our view that SA’s audit, tax and advisory services industry has deteriorated in its mandate to society, through its questionable work and the charging of exorbitant fees,” Outa chief operations officer Ben Theron said. Efforts to get comment from Malaba were unsuccessful. bernards@thenewage.co.za
