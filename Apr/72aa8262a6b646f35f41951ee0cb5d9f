The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has promised to end racism in the North-West town of Coligny following a local by-election victory where the party took away ward 15 from the ANC. The EFF, ANC, and the DA participated in the local by-elections on Wednesday following the death of an ANC Councillor in the area. The party took Ward 15 in Ditsobotla (Thabologang Coligny) from the ANC with 699 votes. The ANC managed to 688 votes while the DA came third with 373 votes. The ANC loses the ward as community members in the area are up in arms in protest calling for North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo to resign from his position following various allegations of corruption. The ANC’s National Working Committee is expected to meet with branches in the area on Thursday to engage them on the future of the Premier. “The EFF is proud for its growth in the North West and shall ensure to represent the people with humility, determination and selflessness. We shall also ensure that racism and white supremacy ends in Coligny. This victory also goes to all fighters and volunteers who worked tirelessly to win people over to the EFF, we congratulate them too,” said the EFF. The alleged ‘racism’ in the area came into the spotlight following the death of Coligny teenager Matlhomola Mosweu who was allegedly killed by two white farmers. Following this victory, the EFF has promised to take over the North West Province. -TNA Reporter
