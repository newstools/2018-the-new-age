The wave of condolences expressed to the family of struggle veteran and former minister Zola Skweyiya continued on Thursday with the ANC Youth League (ANCYL) describing him as a “paragon of political correctness and ethical leadership.” Skweyiya, 75, passed away on Wednesday following a long illness. “His sad passing is a setback to our efforts of fostering principled and genuine unity within the ANC and broader alliance for a successful triumph of the National Democratic Revolution,” the ANCYL said in a statement. “In his memory, the ANCYL commits to preserving his legacy by being at the centre of struggles faced by the youth of South Africa, to deal decisively with the triple challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment and build a future that brings a life of dignity for all,” ANCYL spokesperson Mlondi Mkhize said. Parliament presiding officers, National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete and NCOP Chairperson Thandi Modise also shared their condolences with the Skweyiya family. “We should celebrate his outstanding life and the legacy he leaves behind for the current and future generations to enjoy a better life,” they said in a joint statement. Cosatu on Wednesday said Skweyiya was owed a lot of gratitude for fighting apartheid. “Skweyiya will be remembered as a fearless and straight-talking activist, who loved his country and fought relentlessly against the tyranny of white minority rule,” it said. Cosatu said it saluted him for his contribution in championing the cause of freedom. “We lower our banners in honour of this courageous struggle veteran. We remain inspired by his bravery and unflinching dedication to the cause of our liberation.” According to the family, details of the memorial service and funeral will be communicated
early next week. -TNA Reporter
