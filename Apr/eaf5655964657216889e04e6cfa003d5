A man was killed and another critically injured following a horrific accident on the N3 towards Pietermaritzburg, near the Shongweni offramp, on Tuesday. Two vehicles and a truck reportedly collided before one overturned, coming to rest on its roof. “One driver had sustained major injuries and unfortunately was declared deceased on the scene,” ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said. “The second driver had sustained moderate injuries and was stabilised on the scene. He was later transported to a nearby hospital for the further care.” Traffic has been affected on most of the national highway and motorists have been urged to be patient – or find an alternative route. -TNA Reporter
