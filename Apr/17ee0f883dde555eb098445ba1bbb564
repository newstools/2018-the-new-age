CONVICTED racist Vicki Momberg’s bid to appeal her sentencing and conviction suffered a setback yesterday when the Randburg Magistrate’s Court found her application to be “defective” – and postponed the case for her to submit supplementary documents. State prosecutor Yusuf Baba argued yesterday that Momberg’s application was defective as her defence team had failed to articulate the basis of her appeal in a clear and unambiguous way. The court postponed the matter to April 18. Baba had also argued that the defence had not supplied strong grounds to appeal the conviction and sentencing. Momberg recently became the first person in South Africa to be given a jail term for using the K-word after being convicted of crimen injuria. She was sentenced to two years in jail with an additional year suspended. Members of the Born Free Alliance (BFA), which has expressed alarm at the growing incidents of racism in the country and called for an immediate dialogue on racism, attended the hearing. “It is shocking that after 25 years of so-called freedom that we haven’t yet seen, there is still a person who can still call another person the K-word. That on its own is crime against humanity,” BFA president General Thekiso said. -KEITUMETSI MOTLHALE|keitumetsim@thenewage.co.za
