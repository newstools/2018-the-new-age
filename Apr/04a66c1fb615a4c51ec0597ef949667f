PASSENGER Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) has lost millions of rands as a result of train accidents that happened in this financial year alone. Transport Minister Blade Nzimande reported that R27.8m was lost by the agency during the 2017-18 financial year. Nzimande said Prasa suffered a loss which was almost double the financial loss Prasa incurred during the previous financial year. He said during this financial year alone, eight Shosholoza Meyl coaches were damaged due to accidents, vandalism or theft. Overall, more than 190 coaches were damaged or wrecked due to vandalism or theft, he said. He said the train accident between Kroonstad and Hennenman in Free State in January was one of the accidents that led to a loss of millions of rands by Prasa. The accident claimed the lives of 22 people with more than 100 passengers injured in the horrific accident. Shosholoza Meyl was carrying 429 passengers travelling from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg when the accident happened at a crossing between Hennenman and Kroonstad. Witnesses said that the truck failed to stop at the level crossing, despite theÂ train driver giving warning by blowing the horn. The truck, along with its two trailers, was dragged for about 400m and a car being transported on the train was also crushed by the derailed train. The truck driver survived the collision and tried to flee the scene but was arrested and taken to hospital. Police said they did not find any trace of alcohol in the driver of the truck following tests at a police station. A week later, another accident occurred after an incoming train crashed into a stationary train from behind at the Geldenhuys train station in Germiston where more than 200 commuters suffered minor injuries. Both trains had passengers on board and were headed for Springs in the east of Gauteng. michaelt@thenewage.co.za -MICHAEL TLHAKUDI
