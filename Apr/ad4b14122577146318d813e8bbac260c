Starting this week fans of the acclaimed musical Sophiatown can reminisce at the South African State Theatre in Pretoria. This memorable musical has been revived with a fresh, new, young cast to delight today’s audiences with its timeless music, under the experienced eye of the State Theatre’s multi-award winning artistic director, Aubrey Sekhabi. Sekhabi is also the producer of Freedom the musical, which recently closed and examined the impact of crime and violence in modern day society. Sophiatown features a stellar cast including Thabiso Tshabalala as Jakes, Caitlin Clerk as Ruth, Terrence Ignacious Ngwila as Mingus, Kenneth Mlambo as Fahfee, Simphiwe Ndlovu as Princess, Madge Kola as Mamariti, Zamah Ngubane as Lulu and Bongani Masango as Charlie. This revised version of Sophiatown was first staged last year at the same time as the Market Theatre was staging a version directed by Malcolm Purkey of Junction Avenue Theatre Company. Sekhabi was one of Purkey’s students when he acquired his dramatic arts honours degree in 1991 at Wits. Purkey was amazed by Sekhabi’s version of the play when he attended the performance last year. “I have been directing this play for so many years and watched many versions and I have never seen anything like this one. I am too old, I don’t have to do this production anymore, it is in beautiful and better hands,” he said. Sophiatown is an imaginative reconstruction of an extraordinary story of journalists who set up a house together and advertise for another housemate to come and live with them. Despite the apartheid legislation of those days, they managed to obtain permission for a white Jewish woman to move in. This character was Ruth Golden who turned up with a suitcase on the Sophiatown doorstep of an explosive journalist, Jakes. The challenge was integration. The play is interspersed throughout with acapella harmony and original songs from the period about Sophiatown, or Kofifi as it was fondly known. -TNA Reporter
