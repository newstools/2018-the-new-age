AFROTONE Media Holdings (AMH) announced at the weekend that it had fully settled the purchase price of its acquisition of ANN7 24-hour news television station and national newspaper The New Age. “The paid-up position comes after very tough negotiations between Oakbay (former owners of the assets) and businessman Mzwanele Manyi’s consortium, which led to the varying of the initial vendor finance deal,” Afrotone said. Owing to the operating environment, Oakbay agreed to fully relinquish its hold on the companies’ pledged shares, leading to a newly negotiated settlement deal. Afrotone said that all parties to the agreement had agreed to a price that has since been fully settled by the purchaser for an aggregate amount “in accordance with sound corporate financing principles”. Consequently, Afrotone Media Holdings’ ownership of Infinity Media Networks (ANN7) and TNA Media (The New Age) is now debt-free and unencumbered. “As a truly South African 100% black-owned and managed company, this development strengthens AMH’s position to realise the benefits of this strategic acquisition,” Manyi said. He said “the development should finally put to rest any suspicions of lingering involvement of the Gupta family and, importantly, should provide the much-needed market confidence to avert potential job losses of more than 500, mainly black and young employees”. Afrotone said all affected parties, including Multichoice, had been informed, which paves the way for AMH to embark on a comprehensive rebranding exercise with the aim of repositioning itself as a crucial player in the South African media fraternity and a formidable bidder to replace ANN7 on the DStv bouquet. – 701068 -TNA REPORTER
