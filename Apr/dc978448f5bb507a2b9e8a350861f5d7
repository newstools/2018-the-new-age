Two people will appear in the Louis Trichardt Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday after they were found in possession of a protected species. The two suspects, aged 35 and 42, were arrested during a joint intelligence-driven operation carried out in Makhado outside Thohoyandou in Venda after they were found in illegal possession of a pangolin, which is one of the critically endangered species. Limpopo police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said police members made a follow up after they received a tip-off from community members about the men who were then arrested at a parking lot in the CBD. “During the arrest, a Toyota Hilux bakkie which was used to transport this pangolin was also seized.” Ngoepe said the police are continuing with their investigation on the case. -TNA Reporter
