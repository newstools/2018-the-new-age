Mourners who attended Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s memorial in KwaZulu-Natal gave former president Jacob Zuma a hero’s welcome on Thursday. Zuma, who said he was attending the memorial service as an ordinary African National Congress (ANC) branch member, described Madikizela Mandela as someone who remained committed to the values of the organisation throughout her life. “Winnie Madikizela-Mandela remained committed to the struggle and never sold out,” Thursday’s service was expected to be addressed by deputy president David Mabuza, but it was instead addressed by deputy secretary-general Jesse Duarte as the keynote speaker. It is understood the tensions have not simmered down since Nasrec, where Mabuza was expected to assist the Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma camp claim victory. ANC NEC member Edna Molewa was among those who attended the event. At the same time, mourners sang happy birthday to Zuma who was celebrating his 76th birthday. -TNA Reporter
