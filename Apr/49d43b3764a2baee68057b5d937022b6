The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development (DOJCD) said on Thursday that it had assembled a team to investigate the recent incidents of prison escapes in the country. “There is no stone that is going to be left unturned to get to the actual understanding as to who did what and that there will be consequences to those who are involved in this matter. “We have very good teams that were put together to investigate these escapes and very soon the department will be announcing steps that will be taken against those who are involved,” Deputy Minister Thabang Makwetla told Power FM. He said that the investigations are already underway and they are getting closer to discovering what really transpired in these escapes. This comes after the recent escapes at the Sun City correctional centre and Polsmore prison. Sixteen inmates escaped from Sun City prison last week, it is alleged that they escaped through a pipe shaft where they dug a hole through a wall. Meanwhile, six inmates also escaped from Pollsmoor Prison in March. Makwetla said that the department had earlier suspected that the escapes were related to the over the population that is experienced in prisons. However, upon investigation, they discovered a possibility of criminal activities. “But looking closer at what happened in Sun City correctional centre and Polsmore prison it is quite clear that it’s not a development that is as a result of the increasing population and the fewer officers that we have deployed. It is something that has to do with human mistakes. Some of these cases there is clear collusion by officers with these offenders.” he said. The department suspects that these inmates were aided by officials. -TNA Reporter
