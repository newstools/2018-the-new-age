Two suspects are expected to appear in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court on Monday in connection with the murders of four people, including two children, in the Browns Farm informal settlement in Nyanga. This comes after the pair was arrested at the weekend. A third suspect is still on the run. Four people, including two children, aged 12 and 13, were shot and killed while sitting in a Toyota Avanza last Tuesday. The fifth victim injured in the incident is still recovering in hospital. Police Minister Bheki Cele applauded the swift move by Western Cape police in making sure that the two suspects were arrested. “Police action must always be a step ahead of criminals. We will double our efforts in ensuring that Crime Intelligence must remain a powerful resource in the fight against crime. Crime prevention operations will be enhanced, especially in hotspot areas, in order to bring down the levels of serious and violent crime,” Cele said. The motive for the shooting incident remains unknown at this stage, however, SAPS investigators are hard at work in an effort to get to the bottom of the incident. -TNA Reporter
