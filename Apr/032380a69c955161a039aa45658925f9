North West police on Sunday issued a strong warning to criminals and all those who think they can break the law and get away with it. The warning follows several operations in several parts of the province. On Friday, 25-year-old Lebogang Cedrick Mokgatla was sentenced to 40 years in prison after he was convicted on two counts of rape. According to police spokesperson Kelebogile Moleko, in 2013, Mokgatla raped women from a local tuck shop and also threatened them with a knife. He was arrested in Wolmaransstad. “The court sentenced him to 20 years imprisonment for each count of rape, which will run concurrently. He was also declared unfit to possess a firearm or ammunition in terms of Section 103 of the Firearms Control Act,”Moleko said. In another case, two men will appear at the Mmabatho Magistrates Court on Monday to face two charges of murder. The two were arrested on Friday at Magogwe village in Mmabatho after the murder of Kegopotse Tawana and her daughter Kelebogile who were fatally shot by unknown people at their home in Magogoe Tar Village in September 2015. “The assailants then fled the scene with a laptop, cash and a cellphone after killing the victims.” Meanwhile, the police in Mooinooi have called on the community to help them identify the body of a man who was found with his head cut off. According to the police, the man, who is believed to be in his thirties was found on 29 March wearing a brown T-shirt, blue jersey, black pair of jeans and a brown waist belt. Anyone with information that can help with the identification of the body can contact  Detective Sergeant Sello on 079 357 4633. -TNA Reporter
