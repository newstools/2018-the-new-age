Actress and radio personality Thando Thabethe on Tuesday, in an emotional post on Instagram, thanked Zoleka Mandela for sharing her grandmother Winnie Madikizela-Mandela with her. In her post, she said: “I am not okay  TODAY WAS DIFFICULT!!!… it’s in the last few weeks that @zolekamandela allowed me to share her granny … it’s a gift I will FOREVER cherish”. Madikizela-Mandela passed away at the Netcare Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg on Monday. She had been in and out of hospital due to an infection affecting her kidneys. Thabethe indicated that she went to a crèche, which was literally next door the struggle icon ‘s house and there would be a time where she would be peeking over the wall, trying to spot her or former President Nelson Mandela. I am not okay  TODAY WAS DIFFICULT!!!… it’s in the last few weeks that @zolekamandela allowed me to share her granny … it’s a gift I will FOREVER cherish. My granny lives in the same street as mama, and I went to a crèche literally NEXT door mama’s house. I remember peeking over to try spot her or tata… but a conversation with her is something that will resonate with me for all of my days. Firstly she said I look much smaller in real life!! You can only imagine my shock at the fact that WINNIE MANDELA knew who I was!!! …the peeking toddler!! I asked her about “Winnie” the doccie and  told her I had watched it on Netflix!! She ask d me what time it played and what they had said about her. I told her they reiterated her role in the struggle and how grateful we all were…especially as women, to have her as a leading example. She gave me a kiss on the lips and said that she was glad!! @zolekamandela assured me she had seen the doccie and told me to stop crying!!! Thank you for your heart, your grace and for sharing your granny with us!!! @zolekamandela I’m forever indebted to you for this captured moment A post shared by  Thando Thabooty Thabethe (@thando_thabethe) on Apr 3, 2018 at 8:06am PDT  -TNA Reporter
