MAZDA Southern Africa has recorded 13.5% sales volume growth year on year, with 2.5% market share for the year ended March. The car maker said its business results reflected robust growth for the 2017-18 fiscal year, with the highest recorded vehicle sales since independent operations commenced in October 2014. From April last year to March this year, Mazda SA achieved sales volumes of 13 868 units resulting in growth of 13.5% year-on-year. The company’s market share rose to 2.5% from 2.2% in the previous year, in an industry which only grew 0.2% during the past fiscal year. “Of the total units sold, Mazda CX-5 and the Mazda3 are two of Mazda’s biggest sellers with 50% of the sales volume combined. Mazda2 and Mazda CX-3 account for 46% of the sales volume, while the BT-50 and MX-5 provide the remaining 4%.” The Mazda financial services business grew by more than 172% in the financial year. Mazda SA’s primary aim since independent operations began in 2014 has been to rebuild the brand on all fronts including restoring Mazda resale values. This strategy, the company said, is on track and is being achieved by forming strong relationships with dealers, suppliers and owners. -THELMA NGOMA|thelman@thenewage.co.za
