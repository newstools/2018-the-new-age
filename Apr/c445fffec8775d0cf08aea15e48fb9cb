Former President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane Zuma is to be prosecuted on the charges of culpable homicide for his 2014 incident. The confirmation was made by National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA) spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku on Thursday. Maku said that this came after the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDDP) had reviewed the matter. And therefore a decision has been made to prosecute Mr Duduzane Zuma. The former president’s son missed the deadline that he was offered to give presentations to the NPA on why he should not be prosecuted. NPA head Shaun Abrahams approached Duduzane in February this year requesting him to give reasons why he should not be prosecuted. The case was recently brought to the National Director of Public Prosecution for reconsideration by lobby group AfriForum. This relates to a case where Duduzane was involved in a vehicle accident on the M1 in Johannesburg that led to the death of one female passenger who was in a taxi that was involved in the accident. Duduzane is allegedly on the run after failing to appear before parliament to answer for his alleged involvement at the ongoing state capture inquiry. -TNA Reporter
