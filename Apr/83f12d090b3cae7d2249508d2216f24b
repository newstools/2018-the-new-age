However, I will also use the opportunity to honour the late Mama Winnie Mandela who I adored. “I will be wearing a doek on the red carpet and if anyone asks I will tell them that I am in solidarity with my South African sisters who started the #AllBlackWithDoek campaign in her
(Madikizela-Mandela’s) honour.” -Nontokozo Gxumisa
