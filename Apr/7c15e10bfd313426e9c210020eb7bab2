The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in North West will take Legislature Speaker Susan Dantjie to court for refusing to allow a vote of no confidence against Premier Supra Mahumapelo to be conducted in secret ballot. The party said members of the provincial legislature should be allowed to vote with their conscience, not the party line, adding that can only happen if the vote is conducted through a secret vote. “We agreed to postpone the seating pending the court processes.” Mahumapelo’s woes comes a barely a month after the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) in the province embarked on the march against corruption and also to call on the ANC to remove Mahumapelo as premier. The union is accusing Mahumapelo of facilitating corruption in the province. At the time, provincial deputy secretary Toffies Moemi said the province is riddled with corruption and that the Mediosa scandal bears testimony to the high level of corruption. Last month Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi described the Mediosa contract as a mobile ATM card used by the Gupta family to withdraw money from the government. Mahumapelo did not take kindly to minister’s remarks, accusing Motsoaledi of choosing a populist approach instead of approaching the provincial government regarding the matter. At the time, provincial spokesperson Brian Setswambung said Mahumapelo had decided to elevate the matter to President Cyril Ramaphosa. “The premier has, as a result, stated that he will communicate with the Presidency now that the minister has unfortunately chosen to ignore the province because the province would have basically appraised the minister on work that is being done on this particular matter,” Setswambung said. Meanwhile, during a radio interview, Mahumapelo said he was not shaken by the EFF’s motion, saying that was what was keeping him excited. He added that should his organisation ask him to step down, he would gladly do it. -TNA Reporter
