Following an incident at the FNB Stadium last week where Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela was pelted with bottles by fans after the team’s loss to Chippa United, the team has appealed for calm and patience from supporters. “In as far as Saturday’s event goes, we met with Stadium Management South Africa (SMSA) and the relevant stakeholders that were involved in the organisation of the event, to review all matters relating to the match. “In the interim, we appeal to supporters for calm and patience as there is still a lot to play for in the league and the Nedbank Cup. We believe that there is a lot to fight for as the team is in the semi-final of the Nedbank Cup and there is a possibility of qualification for one of the continental competitions,” Kaizer Chiefs said in a statement on Wednesday. Komphela was pelted with bottles on Saturday after Chiefs were slashed 3-0 at home by Chippa United. Chiefs fans have been calling for the team to expel Komphela due to his poor performance. The team said, following last weekend’s result, it met with the team manager, technical team and players to review the incident in a meeting that lasted five hours. “It is important for our supporters to note that as management, we are listening to their concerns and share the pain.” Chiefs also said it is due to make changes by the end of this season. “One of the notable decisions from the meeting is that decisive changes will have to be implemented at the end of the season to remedy the situation. At this stage, circumstances do not permit for us to make immediate changes.” “However, we are looking to have a complete overhaul of the team before the commencement of the new season.” -TNA Reporter
