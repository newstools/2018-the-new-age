EFF leader Julius Malema on Wednesday said South Africa would be an ugly nation without white people. Malema said this while addressing mourners at late struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s memorial service in Brandfort in the Free State. “You are in the minority but we shall give you space. We complement one another and that is what makes us a unique nation,” Malema said. The EFF leader also said the party’s call for land was not meant to drive white people to the sea but it was appealing to white South Africans to share the land. He dismissed allegations that his party wanted to commit “white genocide,” adding that there was no case recorded of a white person being killed because of land. On the issue of “willing buyer, willing seller”, Malema said the policy did not work, adding that even if people had money to buy the land, it was useless if there was no land to buy. “With the policy of ‘willing buyer, willing seller’, even when you have the money, if there is no land, you cannot sell the land.” During Freedom Day celebrations on 21 March, Deputy President David Mabuza echoed an EFF statement, saying that the expropriation of land needed to be carried out in order for the previously disadvantaged to feel the fruits of freedom. “It is also a day which reminds us that freedom and democracy remain meaningless if the majority of South Africans remain trapped without work, jobs or land,” the deputy president said while speaking at a Human Rights Day event in Sharpeville. Mabuza, however, admitted that the ANC government took its time to deliver on its promise to deal with the land issue. -TNA Reporter
