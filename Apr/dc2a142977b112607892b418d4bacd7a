JUST six days after a R30m drug bust at OR Tambo International Airport, the Hawks arrested a middle-aged couple, who reportedly tried to smuggle drugs worth R2.6m at the Cape Town International Airport. Between April last year and now, SARS has confiscated goods worth more than R2.9bn at entry points across the country. The Cape Town couple will appear in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court today. They were also allegedly carrying about R300 000 in cash. Capt Philani Nkwalase said: “The assortment of drugs that includes cocaine and MDMA (Ecstasy) as well as the cash amount were recovered during an intelligence-driven disruptive operation on a house in Hastings Street, Cape Town.” The 39 year old and 48 year old are facing drug-related charges. SARS Customs recently released statistics for the total number of busts which took place over the past financial year. The combined value of goods confiscated from April 1 last year to March 31 this year adds up to more than R2.3bn. SARS customs officials at OR Tambo International Airport on Friday confiscated 108kg of drugs, which were hidden in boxes and declared as calcium carbonate valued at more than R30m. Officials at the airport discovered a white powdery substance and a brown sand-like substance, which they sent to a private laboratory for testing. The case has been handed over to the Hawks for further investigation. In another incident‚ in February a 42-year-old Seychelles national was arrested at OR Tambo International Airport after being found with drugs strapped to his thighs. Police said while the security officer was searching the passenger, the officer felt an unusual hardness on the passenger’s thighs. The substance, which was heroin, was discovered with a street value of R112 000. The man was about to board a flight to Mahé Island in his country when he was arrested. – 701198 -TNA REPORTER
