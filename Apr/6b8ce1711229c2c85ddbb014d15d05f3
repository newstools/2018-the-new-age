The Justice Ministry has paid over R24 million to cover former President Jacob Zuma’s legal costs since he became president of the country in 2009. This was revealed by FF Plus leader Dr Pieter Groenewald on Tuesday. The information was revealed to the party by Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, Michael Masutha who had been requested to respond to parliament in a question that was posted by Groenewald. The party wanted to know if the department of justice had paid any of Zuma’s legal costs since he became president. “The FF Plus posed the question regarding Zuma’s legal costs in November last year already. Minister Masutha did not respond at the time and the question had to be repeated to get an answer. “This serves as proof that the minister tried to protect Zuma while he was still president as the minister was only willing to disclose the information once he was no longer serving as president,” said FF Plus in a statement. In the case where Zuma questioned the powers of the Public Protector on her Nkandla report, the legal costs are alleged to have amounted to R3,2 million. In another case where Zuma attempt at preventing the state capture report from being issued. The costs amounted to R2,5 million. Meanwhile in the case where the NPA obtained a search warrant to search the offices of Thint and sent a written request to the Mauritius authorities to secure documents, which the former President opposed. The legal costs amounted to R15,3 million. This according to Groenewald is “the only case that has been finalised”. All these cases in total then amount to R24 240 201 million. Following revelations that government had been paying for the former president’s legal cost on his court battles. The DA demanded that Zuma must personally pay for his legal costs. FF Plus says that it also “of the opinion that Zuma must be held personally liable for the legal costs”. -TNA Reporter
