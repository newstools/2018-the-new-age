Former Attorney has been released on an R5000 bail after he was arrested for impersonating an attorney and defrauding Road Accident Fund (RAF) beneficiaries despite being struck from the roll of attorneys by the high court. Nkhangweleni Samson Netshifhefhe, 46, will appear again on, July 10, after he was arrested in Thohoyandou CBD on Wednesday. According to Hawks spokesperson Matimba Maluleke, Netshifhefhe was struck off the roll by Limpopo High Court in 2010 after he embezzled clients money from RAF trust fund. Maluleke said they conducted an investigation after they were informed that he was still claiming money from RAF on behalf of the beneficiaries even after he was truck of the roll. “Investigations revealed that the suspect used his personal bank account to claim money from RAF and he did not pay the beneficiaries, this resulted in him personally unduly benefiting over a million rand.” -TNA Reporter
