The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has called for a shut down of the Fortune Steel Mine on the East Rand after seven miners were injured following an explosion at the weekend. The miners were injured when a furnace exploded. The incident happened on Saturday after the union had led a protest against the “abuse of workers” at the company on Friday. NUMSA members marched against #FortuneSteel on Friday to protest against the abuse of workers. We condemn Labour DEPT for ignoring complaints against the company. .@Powerfm987 .@TimesLIVE .@IOL .@eNCA pic.twitter.com/ES9PsC4Gi0 — NUMSA (@Numsa_Media) April 16, 2018  Numsa alleges that the company does not adhere to basic health and safety laws. The union said that one of the miners who was injured in the explosion was in a critical condition in hospital. “This is because the company refuses to comply with basic health and safety laws!” The company is also accused of having deprived the injured workers immediate proper medical attention after the incident. “They refused to call the ambulance and attempted to transport the injured themselves using private vehicles. It was only with the intervention of the local police that workers received medical care provided for by the ambulances. The management had the audacity to try and downplay the accident as a minor workplace issue,” Numsa acting national spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola reportedly said. #FortuneSteel has been allowed to act with impunity because the Labour Department in Nigel has failed to protect workers against abuse. If the .@deptoflabour had done its job the accident may have been prevented. .@eNCA .@SABCNewsOnline — NUMSA (@Numsa_Media) April 16, 2018  We demand that #FortuneSteel must be shut down until a full investigation confirms that the workplace is safe for workers. .@bonglez .@eNCA .@SABCNewsOnline .@TimesLIVE .@deptoflabour .@mabena_bob pic.twitter.com/2cu8sSQmr3 — NUMSA (@Numsa_Media) April 16, 2018  -TNA Reporter
