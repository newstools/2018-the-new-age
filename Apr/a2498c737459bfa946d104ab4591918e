African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Ace Magashule has called for calm in the North West province amid calls by some of the party members to oust Supra Mahumapelo as Premier. Magashule said the party wants to make sure there is unity and renewal across the board in the regions. “We are here to ensure that the structures of the ANC work together as a unity. I am appealing for calm among our structures until we resolve whatever the challenges we are faced with.” The Secretary-General also said he does not want to point fingers at anyone, adding that all they want to do is to engage everyone in order to bring stability in the province. Meanwhile, the party said it is confident that its members in the North West legislature will not support a motion of no confidence in Premier Supra Mahumapelo. This is after the motion was postponed pending a court process which sought to force the speaker to allow the motion to be conducted in a secret ballot. On Tuesday, North West Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Chairperson and Member of North West Provincial Legislature, Betty Diale confirmed that they received communication on Tuesday on the postponement following their plea for a secret ballot. “Remember the EFF is approaching the court with regard to this matter, particularly with regard to the secret ballot issue, we are actually still busy with that process. “We then through our attorneys, discussed with the speaker the possibility of a postponement of the matter, initially she refused, only this morning we received a confirmation from the speaker that the motion can be postponed because in actual fact the sitting only related to that, it was the only item on the draft order paper for today,” she said at the time. -TNA Reporter
