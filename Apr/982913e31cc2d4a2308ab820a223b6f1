The African Farmers’ Association of South Africa (AFASA) has called on former president Jacob Zuma to return cattle which was allegedly given to him by North West premier Supra Mahumapelo. The association said it has requested an urgent meeting with the Department of Agriculture in the province to demand that the R1.5 million worth of cattle which was meant for emerging farmers be returned as soon as possible. Two weeks ago, the Hawks confirmed that they were investigating a case as a result of allegations that accused the premier of giving away the cattle to Zuma. According to AFASA, while the Hawks are busy conducting their own investigation about the donation, the animals should be returned from the former president’s homestead in Nkandla to the emerging farmers whom the cattle was meant for. AFASA’s secretary, Molefe Mahape says they were shocked when they learnt of the donation. AFASA’s secretary Molefe Mahape told the SABC that they were very shocked when they learned about the donation given the plight of black emerging farmers in the province. “I mean on daily basis our farmers are in need of support, and we have hoped such a gesture will be directed towards our farmers, ” he said. Mahape said when they heard of the donation, they did not believe that something like this could happen, hence their call for an urgent investigation. -TNA Reporter
