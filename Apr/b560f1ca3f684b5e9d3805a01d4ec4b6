The ANC has vowed to intensify its fight against patriarchy within its ranks and in the country, in honour of late veteran Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. The party said it has been inspired by Madikizela-Mandela, who not only embodied the ideals of economic justice for all but also fought with uncompromising resilience for the aspirations of the downtrodden masses. The party was speaking following Madikizela-Mandela’s funeral, which took place on Saturday after she died two weeks ago. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said the party commended South Africans for individually and collectively sharing the burden of pain and loss with the Madikizela and Mandela families. “The nation and the world’s solidarity with the family in their moment of loss made it easier for us and the family to contend with this monumental loss. South Africans, through their support during her last miles into immortality, made a resounding statement of embracing Winnie as their leader and the embodiment of their aspirations,” Mabe said. Mabe also thanked the South African government, the army, the police, emergency services, the media, all political parties and “…most importantly, South Africans and the international community and leaders for their support and solidarity during our moment of collective grief.” “To the family, we want to say they remain an important part of our nation and the party will continue to work with them to preserve and advance the proud and revolutionary legacy of Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.” Mabe said the ANC and the country remained indebted to Mama Winnie’s family and would not be able to repay the debt of gratitude for a long time to come. -TNA Reporter
