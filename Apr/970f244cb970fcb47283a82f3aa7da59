The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) has confirmed the arrest of South African businessman Justin van Pletzen in Dubai over an alleged video recording of Ajay Gupta. However, the department on Thursday said at this stage it was unclear on the “nature” of the charges being levelled against him. “Dirco confirms the arrest of Mr van Pletzen in Dubai. At this stage, the department is unable to provide further details on the nature of the charges against the affected South African in Dubai and on the date of his court appearance,” the department said in a statement. Van Pletzen was arrested earlier this week, for allegedly filming businessman and wanted fugitive Ajay Gupta in Dubai. He was reportedly detained for questioning in relation to the video recording on Monday and later released. “It is alleged that Mr van Pletzen’s arrest is linked to a video he recently circulated about Mr Ajay Gupta, whom he met in Dubai. However, this is yet to be confirmed by the local authorities.” Meanwhile, the department said consular staff from the mission in Dubai had visited van Pletzen on Wednesday following the incident. Dirco has further promised to maintain contact with van Pletzen and his family to render consular services. -TNA Reporter
