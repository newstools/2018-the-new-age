GLOBAL finance group Old Mutual is a step closer to its launch as an independently listed financial services group. It is expected that the listing will take place on June 26 following receipt of the requisite approvals, including approval by the Old Mutual shareholders. “We are excited by the progress we have made,” chief executive officer Peter Moyo said. “The pre-listing statement provides detailed information on Old Mutual Limited and its prospects. “The listing of OML on the JSE will signal the return of Old Mutual to Africa where it is well-positioned to offer the best solutions to our customers within our key client segments,” Moyo said. Over the last few months, OML has reached significant milestones in its listing process. In January its corporate restructuring received approval from the Competition Tribunal and the Department of Economic Development. In February Old Mutual’s homecoming was endorsed by the national Treasury and referred to in the annual budget speech. “We are on track with the completion of the managed separation process and thank all our stakeholders for their continued support” Moyo said. Old Mutual and Nedbank have also signed their relationship agreement to govern the terms of the relationship upon completion of the managed separation and replace the historic relationship agreement between Old Mutual and lender Nedbank. The proposals to finalise the managed separation required Old Mutual shareholder and UK Court approvals. If the proposals are approved by shareholders and the UK Court and upon listing of the relevant securities, for every three Old Mutual shares held shareholders will receive at least one ordinary share in Quilter (formerly Old Mutual Wealth) and three ordinary shares in Old Mutual. -THELMA NGOMA|thelman@thenewage.co.za
