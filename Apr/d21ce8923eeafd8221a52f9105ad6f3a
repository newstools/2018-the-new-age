Former ANC Youth League Deputy president and the party’s councilor in the Nelson Mandela Bay metro Andile Lungisa has been found guilty of assault by the Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court. Lungisa was found guilty of assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm. He previously pleaded not guilty after smashing a glass jug full of water over the head of a former member of the mayoral committee Rano Kayser during a scuffle in the Nelson Mandela Bay council meeting in 2016. A video of the assault was distributed widely on numerous social media platforms where it shows Lungisa hitting Kayser over the head with the jug. Lungisa has always maintained that he acted in self-defense after he felt threatened by Kayser. -TNA Reporter
