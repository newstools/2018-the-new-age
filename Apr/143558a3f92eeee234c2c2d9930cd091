North West premier Supra Mahumapelo has reportedly offered an R1.5m worth of cattle to former President Jacob Zuma as a gift. The herd of cattle reportedly worth a price tag of R1.5-million was allegedly meant for emerging farmers in the NW province. The Sunday Times is reporting that this gift to Zuma gift was allegedly paid for with public funds. The matter is also reported to be to be under investigation by the Hawks. According to the paper, the former President allegedly ‘personally’ signed for the 25 cattle which were delivered to his Nkandla homestead in KZN in 2016. The paper reports that invoices show that 50 cows were paid for, but details are not clear on where the other 25 ended up. Mahumapelo has recently come under fire to resign as premier after being accused of corrupt relations with the Gupta family and being linked to over his linked to a number of other corruption scandals. Residents in Mafikeng took to the streets and burnt a bus, barricaded roads demanding for the resignation of Mahumapelo this past week. His son was also recently reported to have been offered a bursary worth over R1.1 million to study as a pilot by state-owned defence company Denel. Debel allegedly had to “bend the rules” to offer Mahumapelo’s son the bursary. Denel CEO Zwelakhe Ntshepe was alleged to have personally signed the contract which authorised the bursary. However, the North West premier dismissed the reports and said that his son was offered the bursary on merit. -TNA Reporter
