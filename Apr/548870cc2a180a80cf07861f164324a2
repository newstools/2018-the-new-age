Limpopo police have arrested the wife of a local businessman as a possible suspect in connection with his death. Thaba Security Company owner Ngwako William Mathebula was shot and killed in front of his son and helper in Flora Park, east of Polokwane, in February. At the time, the police said the deceased’s 11-year-old son was confronted by three unknown suspects at the gate of his home as he was about to go to school, who pushed him and the housekeeper back into the house then proceeded to shoot dead the businessman who was in one of the rooms. Police spokesperson Motlafela Mojapelo said a team of detectives and provincial tracking team followed up on information and conducted a sting operation in Lephalale last week where they arrested Simon Ramela, who is also a businessman, for his alleged involvement in the killing. “Information on his arrest was embargoed until Tuesday to enable the officers to make a follow up on crucial information that led to the arrest of the alleged girlfriend of one of the conspirators, who is the wife of the deceased,” Mojapelo said. “She was nabbed following intensive police investigations.” According to Mojapelo, the police recovered a pistol, 10 live rounds of ammunition and two motor vehicles during the arrest. Ramela has already appeared in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court on a charge of murder and will again appear again on Wednesday. -TNA Reporter
