Black First Land First leader Andile Mngxitama said on Monday that the BLF intends to lay criminal charges of corruption against the Oppenheimers over the private international airport terminal at OR Tambo. ‘We are preparing a statement to be presented to the police. We want to open a criminal case against the Oppenheimer family, the latest is Wednesday. We are shocked again as BLF but this private operation of a private airport has indications of being grated to corrupt means, said Mngxitama. This comes after reports by the Sunday Times that alleges a letter that was written by an ANC official  in 2015 to the Oppenheimer family informing them that they would be offered the permission to operate a private international airport terminal at the OR Tambo airport. “The Oppenheimers know that if they want to apply for a permit they go to government, they don’t go to the ANC as a political party in Luthuli House, which is what they have done in this case,” he said.  Mngxitama said that the private operation by the Oppenheimer at the airport threatened national security. He said that beyond opening a criminal case against the family, the BLF would further put pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa “to make sure that the judicial commision of inquiry on state capture which was announced by President Zuma at the time is no longer delayed.”  He further added that the ANC must also take a clear stand on the Oppenheimers’ matter and cooperate with the police. -TNA Reporter
