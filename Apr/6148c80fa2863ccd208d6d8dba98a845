Two constables were granted R500 bail each by the Ventersdorp Magistrate’s Court on Monday. The pair, Baatile John Murambiwa, 39 and Thebeethata Reginald Mandlane, 44, were arrested following investigations into a complaint alleging that on 9 January 2018, they stopped and searched a delivery van with furniture. It is alleged that there were some items in the van which were apparently not listed on the inventory. “The officers then allegedly threatened the driver with arrest and demanded a R550 bribe. The money was subsequently deposited by the owner into one of the suspect’s accounts,” Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso said. The Provincial Head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, Major-General Linda Mbana has warned police officers to desist from abusing their authority. “Those who prey on innocent people will face the full might of the law,” she said. The case has been postponed to 25 April. -TNA Reporter
