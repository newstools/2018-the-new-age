In celebrating the life of freedom fighter, activist and former General-Secretary of the South African Communist Party (SACP), Chris Hani, the University of Cape Town (UCT) is expected to honour the late struggle stalwart by naming one of its buildings after him. Hani was assassinated on 10 April 1993, outside his home in Dawn Park, Boksburg. Hani was the leader of the SACP and chief of staff of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the armed wing of the ANC and was a fierce opponent of the apartheid government. UCT spokesperson Nombuso Shabalala said the New Science Lecture Theatre is to be renamed the Chris Hani Lecture Theatre in honour of Hani’s contribution to South Africa’s democracy. The official renaming ceremony will be held on 25 April and the Hani family will be attending. Meanwhile, Transport Minister and SACP Secretary-General Blade Nzimande will deliver the keynote address at an event to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Chris Hani’s death. The commemoration will be held at Thomas Nkobi Memorial Park in Ekurhuleni.
