City of Cape Town Executive Mayor Patricia de Lille is scheduled to speak at a memorial service for late struggle veteran Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, organised by the EFF, at the Majwemasweu Stadium in Deeplevel, Brandfort on Wednesday. The struggle veteran passed away last week at the age of 81 at the Netcare Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg following a long illness. While the ANC organised the national memorial service for the late Mama Winnie, as she was affectionately known, the EFF is hosting a memorial service for the late struggle veteran in Brandfort. The service is to be addressed by EFF leader Julius Malema while other members of the EFF including Floyd Shivambu are attending the main memorial service at Orlando Stadium in Soweto, Johannesburg. #EFFWinnieMandelaMemorialService Program for the day in #Brandfort.
