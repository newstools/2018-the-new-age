ANC Women’s League (ANCWL) President Bathabile Dlamini on Monday lauded the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela for being a giant that was not afraid to challenge patriarchy in the ANC, and outside in society. Dlamini was speaking outside Madikizela-Mandela’s home in Soweto, where members of the Women’s League went to pay their respects to their former president. The stalwart, affectionately named Mother of the Nation but ANC supporters and fellow South Africans, died last week after a long illness. Dlamini said those who are criticising Mama Winnie are just are intimidated by her legacy, as she was a giant and likened the criticism with those who were not happy with the current ANC leadership was elected in December. “We’re saying to all those who are insulting our leadership, to hell with them,” Dlamini said. Dlamini referred to Madikizela-Mandela as someone who was beautiful on the inside and outside, who was always willing to side with the poor. -TNA Reporter
