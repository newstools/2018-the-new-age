Executive Mayor of the City of Johannesburg Herman Mashaba has on Wednesday expressed his condolences after learning of the loss of another JMPD officer to a senseless crime. It is reported that officer Ayanda Zulu was shot twice during the early hours of Wednesday morning as she was leaving her home in Palm Springs south of Johannesburg. The Chief interacted with the late Inspector Ayanda Zulu at the Inauguration. As the Department we are devasted by her loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and her colleagues.

Yet, there is no fairness when a senseless crime is committed and an innocent person be they a resident or public servant dies as a result of a crime,” he added. Public Safety MMC Michael Sun is expected to call for a specialised task team to be formed between the Johannesburg and Tshwane Metro Police Departments as well as the South African Police Service. It is said that the task team will be responsible for investigating the murders of metro police officers. “I wish to extend my sincere condolences to the families of this fallen officer and I will ensure that as the Department of Public Safety, we do all in our power to find and hold the culprit(s) to account,” said Sun. -TNA Reporter
