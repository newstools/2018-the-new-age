Mophie has launched its Mophie Power Capsule in South Afica. The company said this is a premium case designed to power and protect small, compatible wireless devices, wearables and other accessories. The Mophie Power Capsule is a combination case and external battery called the Power Capsule. This device, like many of Mophie’s other devices, acts as a basic protector of a device while it charges it with its own built-in battery. The case itself can be charged with a micro-USB cord, also included with the device. “The Power Capsule holds a built-in 1 400mAh battery, providing up to eight full charges for wireless earbuds. “The integrated USB output also charges a variety of electronics including wearables, fitness trackers and more. Pass-through capabilities allow both the Power Capsule and your device to charge simultaneously,” Mophie said “Once your device is fully charged, an automatic shut-off will engage to ensure maximum charge. “Easy to find LED power indicators displayed on the outside of the case allow you to check charging status without needing to open the case.” The portable is great for those who are jogging and a perfect solution for those with active lifestyles who are always on the go. With the built-in 1 400mAh battery, this compact travel case is more than just a wireless headphone charger as it keeps your fitness trackers or other wearables charged and protected while safely packed away. The Mophie Power Capsule is available now at Musica stores nationwide at a recommended retail price of R699. -INDIE BOYCE|indiphileb@thenewage.co.za
