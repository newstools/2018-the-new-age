The Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Athol Trollip told Democratic Alliance delegates in Tshwane that the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) were in the pocket of ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa. Trollip said this on Saturday at the party’s conference at the Tshwane events centre. “President Ramaphosa ANC has EFF leader Julius Malema in his/their pocket. Parties like the ANC and the EFF are becoming more and more desperate”. He further said that both the ANC and Eff will try by all means to attack the DA from all directions. The Nelson Mandela Mayor went on to highlights his party’s achievement, saying that they have achieved so much and that they were the party to govern. Trollip also told delegates that he was looking forward to 2019 where Mmusi Maimane would be the president of the country. He is expected to contest the second influential position in the party with the current Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga. Both mayors will go head to head for Federal Chairmanship position which is currently being occupied by James Selfe. According to reports, Msimanga enjoys support from Gauteng, Mpumalanga, and KwaZulu-Natal respectively. Trollip is also a heavyweight in the party and possesses a lot of power within party structures. It is believed that he played a crucial role in making sure that the current leader Mmusi Maimane occupies the position his currently holding. -TNA Reporter
