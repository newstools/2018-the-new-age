Convicted racist Vicki Momberg will on Wednesday appear in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court, where she will apply for leave to appeal a conviction on crimen injuria charges and a three-year imprisonment sentence. Momberg was last month found guilty on three counts of crimen injuria by Magistrate Pravina Rugoonandan and sentenced to three years imprisonment, with one year suspended. Last week, Momberg made a brief appearance in the same court where the case was postponed after the court was told that her lawyer Kevin Lawlor had been hospitalised. Momberg was convicted after she racially attacked a police officer who was trying to help her after her car was damaged in smash and grab incident in 2016, in an incident that was captured on video. In the video, Momberg used the k-word 48 times. -TNA Reporter
