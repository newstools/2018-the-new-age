As she prepares to release her long-in-the-works album “Joyride,” Tinashe has released a video for a new single that features Ty Dolla $ign and French Montana. The track, called “Me So Bad,” is the third song out from the album. All the tracks so far have been collaborations: “No Drama” with Offset, “Faded Love” with Future and now both Ty Dolla $ign and French Montana featuring on the newest release. The accompanying video sees the R&B singer sporting a yellow plaid tennis outfit as she steps onto a court to hit bright pink tennis balls and dance by turns. Other scenes find her clad in the same bright pink while she sits in a golf cart and a lounge chair, where she is joined by Ty Dolla $ign, and later at a desk where she is joined by French Montana in a fur coat. “Joyride” is slated to drop on April 13. Earlier this week Tinashe revealed the track listing, with 13 songs including the title track and a collaboration with Little Dragon on “Stick with Me.”  -Relaxnews
