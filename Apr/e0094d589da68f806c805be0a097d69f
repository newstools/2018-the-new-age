ONE of the country’s biggest exports, comedian Trevor Noah, was listed among Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in 2018. Noah shares the spotlight with Hollywood A-listers like Cardi B, Jenifer Lopez and tennis player Roger Federer. An article published by the magazine, read: “Time’s annual list of the world’s most influential people is a designation of individuals whose time, in our estimation, is now. The Time 100 isn’t a measure of power, though many on the list wield it.” For his latest achievement, Noah was congratulated by Kenyan-born Hollywood star Lupita Nyong’o, who lauded him for his role in uplifting black comedians. “A fantastic storyteller, he has always been a defier of rules, which he broke simply by being born in his native country. At The Daily Show, which he has truly globalised, Trevor seeks out comedians of colour in every possible venue, no matter how small,” Nyong’o said. Another South African who is flying the country’s flag high is Miss South Africa turned Miss Universe 2017, Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters, who recently announced she’s been signed by the international model agency, IMG, the same agency which represents highly acclaimed Victoria’s Secret Angel Candice Swanepoel and Kate Moss. Meanwhile, local rappers AKA, Big Star and Tshegofatso “Tshego” Ketshabile are among the 11 global finalists for the Midem Artist Accelerator which kicks off on June 5. -NONTOKOZO GXUMISA|nontokozog@thenewage.co.za
