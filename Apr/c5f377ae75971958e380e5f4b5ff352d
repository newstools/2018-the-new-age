Trade union federation Cosatu on Wednesday said the late Zola Skweyiya will be remembered as a fearless activist, who loved his country and fought relentlessly against white minority rule. This comes after the former minister and South Africa High Commissioner passed away due to a long illness at age 75 on Wednesday morning. “The people of South Africa owe people like comrade Skweyiya a lot of gratitude for fighting the apartheid dictatorship without flinching. He has left an indelible mark as an activist, a diplomat and crusader for social justice,” Cosatu national spokesperson Sizwe Pamla said. While sending its condolences to Skweyiya’s family Cosatu also paid tribute to him saying he was part of a generation that took on the apartheid regime and that showed moral courage. “We salute him as the working class for his contribution in championing the cause of freedom. We lower our banners in honour of this courageous struggle veteran. We remain inspired by his bravery and unflinching dedication to the cause of our liberation.” Earlier, the ANC described its veteran as a “gentle giant of the anti-apartheid struggle” ANC NEC member Thoko Didiza described Skweyiya as a “gallant fighter of the struggle” and also doubled down on the message that his passing marks the ending of a generation of fighters who took up the fight for liberation. “We will remember them by doing what they would have done had they lived,” she said. -TNA Reporter
