THE South African acting fraternity has mourned the death of 39-year-old actor Odwa Shweni as calls for improved safety working conditions intensify. Shweni who died in the Drakensberg while shooting an action scene, is said to have plunged more than 40 metres to his death over a waterfall, during rehearsals for the film, Outside. His body was recovered on Friday morning from the Sterkspruit waterfall close to Monk’s Cowl where he slipped and fell. The South African Guild of Actors vice chairperson, Adrian Galley, said Shweni’s death was devastating for the local film industry. “Let us not forget that the actor was somebody’s father and somebody’s husband and son,” Galley said. “We are devastated at his death and our condolences go to his family. Like in any other industry and working environment, the issue of safety is important. “Though at this point in time we cannot comment on the specifics of this particular case, as the Guild of Actors, we are looking into the matter with an inquest.” Galley further said as the industry they maybe needed to look at how best to reinforce safety requirements. “Our industry does have good safety regulations, but maybe we need to sit down and find out how more can we enforce them so that no other incidents such as this one happen again,” Galley said On social media, scores of local actors sent their condolences to Shweni, with Florence Masebe asking the Department of Arts and Culture to investigate the matter. On Twitter, Masebe said: “@ArtsKZN an actor died while filming illegally at a location in your province. Please demand a full report so that his family may know the truth. We must not allow this story to be downplayed just because Shweni was an unknown actor. Someone in this production disregarded serious safety protocols.” Shweni’s memorial service will be held at 1pm today at Doves Funerals, 147 Malibongwe Drive, Randburg. siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
