The leader of the Pretoria-based Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG) Church, Prophet Shepherd Bushiri, on Monday denied allegations that he is being investigated by the Hawks for money laundering. Speaking to the SABC, Bushiri said he had no knowledge of any investigations taking place. “It’s quite funny because I have never been officially told by the Hawks, neither by the police that I am being investigated. So in short, I am not aware of those investigations apart from learning from the media,” he said. “Apart from that, I don’t think there are any investigations taking place because I inquired with the Hawks and to the police through my lawyers if I am being investigated and they officially answered us to say they are not aware of any investigations.” This follows reports that Bushiri was being suspected of externalising about R15 million from South Africa. The money was alleged to have been transported out of the country on Bushiri’s private jet. Bushiri’ said these claims were false as he could not afford that reported amount of money and that his private jet was out of use at that time, as it had been under maintenance for the past 10 months. He also denied using his church as a business, as he had been accused. Bushiri said that he had entered into the mining and farming business before coming to South Africa to start the church. -TNA Reporter
