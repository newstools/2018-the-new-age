In partnership with Touch HD, Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa will on Wednesday launch the book, Jazz Epistles, The Living History. The book, which was written by Nandi Molefe, is a historical account of the story of the legendary Jazz Epistles. Molefe’s dream with the book was to reignite the dialogue of the importance of the preservation and promotion of South Africa’s heritage and arts. “Young South African artists need to know that their jazz forefathers shook the world with their raw South African sound. These jazz legends broke down the doors of the Grammys, Hollywood concert halls and international royal houses. The story of the Jazz Epistles, The Living History is a privilege to share due to the fact that we still have three of the seven original band members with us to honour,” Molefe said. Jazz Epistles, The Living History was born out of the group’s reunion concert in 2016 which was co-produced by Touch HD CEO Tbo Touch. “It is important to share with younger generations the life stories and narratives of our legends and their immense contribution to our freedom. Our current musical culture has been shaped by these three musical maestros and other legends whose music and contribution resonate with us but also has found eager audiences on the stages of the world,” Mthethwa said. The book details the story of the Jazz Epistles, a jazz band with late Hugh Masekela, Abdullah Ibrahim and Jonas Gwangwa and the musical journey they travelled together in an innovative and intimate way. Mthethwa wrote the forward with the introduction written by the former Mayor of Ekurhuleni Mondli Gungubele. The book explores the backstory of how the Jazz Epistles came to be a world-renowned jazz band and how their excellence in their craft put South Africa on the global music map. It also touches on the context of SA Jazz in the ‘African jazz’ genre and how SA jazz of the 1960 & the 70s impacted on the global anti-apartheid movement. -TNA Reporter
