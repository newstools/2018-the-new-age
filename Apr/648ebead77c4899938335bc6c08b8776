The DA has joined fellow South Africans in commemorating the 25th anniversary of Chris Hani’s passing. DA National Spokesperson Refiloe Nt’sekhe said, in a country where racism and prejudice still reared its ugly head, South Africans must remember that Hani made the ultimate sacrifice for the country. “In remembering his death, the country must ensure that his death was not in vain,” Nt’sekhe said. She said South Africa had a responsibility to play a part in ensuring that social cohesion was realised and that the reconciliation process continued. “Hani was a leader who knew that the struggle for truth and lasting liberation would not end when democracy was attained but that the struggle for social justice must continue.” Hani was the leader of the SACP and chief of staff of uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the armed wing of the ANC. He was assassinated on 10 April 1993 outside his home in Dawn Park, Boksburg. Apartheid-era Conservative Party member Clive-Derby-Lewis and Polish immigrant Janusz Waluś were sentenced to life imprisonment for his death. Derby-Lewis died in 2016, after his release on parole. Waluś is currently serving a life sentence. “This senseless killing was an attempt to derail our country’s democratic process and almost brought South Africa to the brink of civil war. Hani warned against governments abusing their power for personal gain and not for the advancement of our people and it is sad to see that positions of power remain infiltrated by corrupt and out of touch leaders who have failed to change the status quo.” The party said it continued to remember Hani and would continue to work to realise his dreams for South Africa. -TNA Reporter
