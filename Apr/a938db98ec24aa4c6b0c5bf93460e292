The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) has accused President Cyril Ramaphosa of undermining it by announcing that he would visit Marikana. Ramaphosa, who was delivering the eulogy at Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s funeral on Saturday, said he would honour a promise he made to Madikizela-Mandela to visit the widows of miners in the mining area with EFF leader Julius Malema, as part of a healing process for the killing of 34 miners during wage strike at the Lonmin platinum mine in 2012. Ramaphosa, who was a non-executive director of the company at the time, wrote an email to the then police minister Nathi Mthethwa asking to take “concomitant action” after 44 people, including police officers, were killed during the strike. He is accused of issuing an instruction that led to the killing of miners in Marikana. Amcu President Joseph Mathunjwa said the union was not happy with political parties using miners to resolve their differences. “This marriage of convenience between the EFF and President Ramaphosa shouldn’t use Marikana in their political game. “To suggest that the EFF are the gatekeepers to visit Marikana, we find this notion very wrong,” Mathunjwa told SABC. -TNA Reporter
