Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene has announced that The South African Revenue Service (Sars) managed to collect R1.266 trillion for the 2017/2018 tax year. According to Nene, the greater percentage of the money was raised through Personal Income Tax (PIT), Value-Added Tax (VAT) and Company Income Tax (CIT). The amount is lower compared to R1.217 trillion which was forecast by former Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba. Minister Nene also announced that President Cyril Ramaphosa is busy finalising details of an inquiry that will focus on investigating a number of issues at the revenue service. “We need to strengthen our administration. “On Mr Tom Moyane, that is a matter which the President is attending to but we hope for an expeditious resolution so that we have certainty in that regard,” he said. Nene said the government is expecting to collect R22.9 billion following a 1% increase in the Value Added Tax (VAT) which came into effect on April 1 and GDP growth of up to1.5% in 2018, and more than 2% in 2019. -TNA Reporter
