Retired Judge Nkola Motata faces impeachment after the Judicial Conduct Tribunal that was investigating his 2007 ‘drunk’  incident where he drove into a wall in Johannesburg found him guilty of racism and misconduct. The Judge crashed his Jaguar into a wall at a residential area whilst under the influence of alcohol. He is alleged to have made racist remarks in reference to white people on the scene. In a recording of the day of the incident, the Judge is alleged to have uttered the words: “It was the white man’s country, but it is not any more” and “no white man will criticise me”. The Judicial Tribunal has also found that the now-retired Motata displayed a lack of integrity in the manner in which he permitted his legal representatives to proceed to argue his case out that he wasn’t drunk meanwhile he was drunk. The charges were at the time brought against Motata by civil rights group AfriForum. According to AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel, this ruling was a victory for all people who believe that prominent figures in society cannot be allowed to get away with racist remarks simply because of their position. “Should the JSC accept the JCT’s recommendation and start the process to fire Motata, it will make history, seeing as it will be the first time that a Judge is removed from his post due to misconduct,” Kriel said. -TNA Reporter
