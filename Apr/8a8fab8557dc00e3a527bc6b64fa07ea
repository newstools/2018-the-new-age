Civil Rights Organisation AfriForum has on Tuesday unveiled a memorandum destined for the international community as it embarks on its campaign against the proposal for the expropriation of land without compensation. Following the proposal for the expropriation of land without compensation. The organisation expressed its disapproval of the move and threatened to undertake a campaign to the international community and investors to persuade them to pressurise government into setting aside its expropriation policy. The organisation has revealed that it is undertaking its first leg of that campaign as its delegation is set to travel to the USA next week. The lobby group is accusing the government of having a racist agenda in its call for expropriation. “Government’s attempts to expropriate land without compensation have a clear racist motive,” said AfriForum. AfriForum deputy CEO Ernst Roets said that Government’s viewpoint on land reform presented three core problems including an allegation that there is a great demand for land, which according to Afriforum is false with regard to agricultural land. Roets claims that the land policy is based on a distortion of South Africa’s history. The proposal for the expropriation of land without compensation came after a motion presented by the EFF in Parliament which was supported by political parties including the ANC. The DA opposed the motion. The group disputes the notion that white land owners obtained land through oppression, which it describes as a  ‘distortion’. According to AfriForum, most of the land owned by white people was legally bought. Meanwhile, AfriForum has also released a report on the ownership of land in the country. According to their report 24,03% of land in the country in under the ownership of government. -TNA Reporter
