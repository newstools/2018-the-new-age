KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu has sends his condolences to the family of  struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela following her sad passing away at Netcare Milpark Hospital on Monday. “Though we have been aware of her ill-health since January, we were relieved when the leadership of the ANC led by President Cyril Ramaphosa visited her at home. We have been nursing hopes that she will recover fully and be with us as we begin freedom month.” “As the people of KwaZulu-Natal we will forever be indebted to Winnie Mandela. She spent time in this province during the difficult times of political violence – often risking her life in her quest to assist vulnerable members of our communities, especially women and children who were affected by violence in the Midlands.” “We recall that when the last President of apartheid South Africa F.W De Klerk announced the unbanning of political parties such as the ANC, SACP, PAC and other liberation organisations, violence escalated in Pietermaritzburg prompting Winnie Mandela to express her concerns that the third force was behind the escalation of black-on-black violence.” “We will remember her when he comforted many families in Mpumuza, Mafunze, Inadi, Imbali and Sobantu who were affected. Many had lost their loved ones and had their houses burnt down. Most of the victims were accommodated at the Mason Mill refugee camp in Table Mountain. Winnie Mandela was a symbol of hope as she was always there for them.” “We will forever acknowledge her contribution towards the fight for political freedom and against all injustices. We are calling upon the people of this province to join in expressing condolences to Winnie Mandela’s, family and relatives during this difficult period.” “May the departed Soul Rest in Peace.”  -TNA Reporter
