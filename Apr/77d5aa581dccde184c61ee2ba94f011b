The development and transformation of the media sector are of primary importance to our country and a critical ingredient of our efforts at promoting social cohesion as envisioned by the National Development Plans’ Vision, said Communication Minister Nomvula Mokonyane. Following Afrotone Media Holding’s announcement last week that it has finalised its acquisitions of ANN7 and The New Age, Mokonyane extended a congratulatory message and said the company has given the country an opportunity to celebrate the emergence of a 100% black-owned media enterprise. Mokonyane said that she is cognizant of the dim views that are often discriminatory and unfair which some sectors of the media and public have held against ANN7 and The New Age. “We are pleased that Afrotone Media Holdings has emerged as of a 100% black-owned media enterprise whose intentions we hope will be to become an independent, credible and diverse media broadcaster, providing an alternate viewpoint to a national discourse. “South Africa and its constitution guarantee the freedom of the press and as a department, we will defend the right of all licensed media outlets to broadcast fairly and without fear or favour. The intimidation of journalists and media agencies goes against the grain of our constitutional democracy “We are also pleased that the deal secures the employment future of over 500 employees currently with the Infinity Media Networks and TNA Media,” Mokonyane said. -TNA Reporter
