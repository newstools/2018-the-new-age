Motorists have a few hours to fill up their tanks as the fuel price is expected to increase by one of the highest amounts in a long time. The increase can be attributed to the increased fuel levy announced by former Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba in February and a steep increase in international fuel prices, which had remained stable in February but increased in the middle of March. Gigaba announced a 52 cents increase in Road Accident Fund levy, which is in line with other tax adjustments like a 1% increase in VAT which now brings it to 15%. Last week, Energy Minister Jeff Radebe announced a 72 cents increase for 95 octane petrol while 93 Octane will go up by 69 cents. All grades of diesel will also go up by 65.2 cents per litreÂ and illuminating paraffin will be going up by 2 cents a litre. -TNA Reporter
