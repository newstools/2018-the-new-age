Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) spokesperson Zanele Sabela said on Monday that unions will meet to find a solution to end the national bus strike that now enters its second week. The unions met with the Department of Labour last week but the engagements failed to bear any fruits. The bus operators are protesting over wages and better working conditions. “This morning [Monday], Unions will be meeting again to decide on the way forward.
The strike still goes on because on Thursday we met, first we met with the Minister of Transport Blade Nzimande and the Minister of labour and they urged us to come to a resolution, they also met with the employers and they left us to deal with the CCMA,” Sabela said. The union accused the employers of having given them an ultimatum to accept the offer or they would have to settle for their initial offer. “Unfortunately while Labour was having a caucus deciding which of the issues were still outstanding that we should put off for later, maybe to a task team. “We got word from the employers saying that they were giving us an ultimatum that we should accept the offer on the table by Wednesday or else they would revert back to a lower offer,” she said. The Union has again apologised to commuters for the inconvenience as they have to find alternative transport while the strike enters its second week. Sabela said that the negotiations with the employer had reached a deadlock as the employer was offering a 9% increase that would start on May, which according to the union would equate to 11 months increase instead of 12. She added that they are also not reaching an understanding with the issue of the secondary driver where the employer refuses to compensate the bus driver who accompanies the main driver but is not driving when the trip stars. -Afro Worldview
