DA member of Parliament in the Gauteng legislature Makashule Gana has declared his availability to be considered as the party’s candidate for premier of Gauteng. Gana said, as the party leader Mmusi Maimane said during the party’s Federal Congress at the weekend, the 2019 election would be a pivotal moment for the country as the party wants to win Gauteng, not because the party is ambitious for office but because it has the potential to make South Africa more equal, more inclusive, more prosperous and more responsive to the challenges of the changed global order. He said he believes the DA has the potential to win Gauteng, hence his decision to avail  himself to be the Gauteng premier candidate.
