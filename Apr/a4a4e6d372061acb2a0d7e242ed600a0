Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle will on Tuesday launch the Provincial Health Rural Broadband-Connectivity Initiative at the Qunu Clinic near Mthatha in the Eastern Cape. In February, during his 2018 State of the Province Address (Sopa), Masualle indicated that the province would be officially opening the new state of the art Cecilia Makiwane Hospital. “This facility is now operational and boasts the most modern medical equipment and technology, which will radically improve the level of healthcare for the people of Buffalo City and feeder areas,” Masualle said during his address. The premier is also expected to unveil the broadband connectivity capability at Qunu Clinic, which will allow medical personnel at the healthcare facility to confer with their counterparts are at other hospitals. Among the expectant benefits from the technology will be the significant decrease or near elimination of the commute to referral hospitals, which are often located far from where patients reside, deliver prescriptions over long distances in real time and allow specialist doctors to perform medical procedures and consult with patients remotely. On Tuesday morning, Masualle visited the Njezweni location in Ngqeleni in the Nyandeni local municipality where he delivered sewing machines to the Siyazama Sewing Group. The Siyazama Sewing group is made up of 12 women who approached the Office of the Premier for support of their cooperative to start a women empowerment initiative that would see local women acquire sewing skills and create crafts that are sold for an income. -TNA Reporter
