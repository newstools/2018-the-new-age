Canadian hip-hop artist Drake would rap about hit video game “Fortnite,” but not until developer Epic implements a “Hotline Bling” dance. Free action game “Fortnite” has become such a hit that its mainstream appeal can be seen in televised sports. Among them, star soccer player Antoine Griezmann replicated one of the game’s celebratory dances after scoring during a Europa League quarter-finals match last week. Australian rugby league centre Josh Dugan mimicked the game’s bandaging gesture in a display of self-depreciating humour after bagging a try for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks in early March. And players from Major League Baseball teams such as the Houston Astros and Boston Red Sox have been co-opting “Fortnite” celebrations to commemorate their own achievements. For a game about being the last person standing in a 100-player mad-dash shoot-out, one of the strengths of “Fortnite” strengths lies in its ability to keep things casual. Its selection of player emotes are faintly ridiculous, their exaggerated movements tending towards the clownish, and are widely received as a celebration of the game itself as much as a toast to a player’s own abilities — a sentiment that has helped carry “Fortnite” beyond its own arena and towards wider mainstream enjoyment. Now Canadian rapper Aubrey Graham — better known as Drake — wants to reverse the flow and have one of his dance moves put into the game. When he teamed up with the prominent player and Twitch streamer Tyler “Ninja” Blevins in mid-March, along with labelmate Travis Scott and NFL player JuJu Smith-Schuster, their live stream broke Twitch TV records. The pair played for an audience once more on April 10, during which time Ninja asked if Drake would rap about the game on his upcoming album. -Relaxnews
