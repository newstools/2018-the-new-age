Archbishop Thabo Makgoba has delivered a commanding message to the current ANC leadership under President Cyril Ramaphosa to usher in a new administration that will be different from the previous one. Preaching at the St George’s Cathedral Easter church service in Cape Town, the Archbishop said: “Let us resolve never again to allow our government and our leaders to talk us down, to let us down or to keep us down. God can give anyone a second chance and he has given South Africa that opportunity. “So my wish for this Easter is that President Ramaphosa and the ANC should see this time as a moment in history to embrace the principles and objectives of the New Struggle – a struggle to which we all should commit: a struggle for equality, a struggle about values and
institutions rather than personalities, a struggle to build strong systems which cannot be undermined by one party or person’s whim,” the Archbishop was quoted saying. He said that though the country could not start over, it had offered a new opportunity for a second chance. “There has never been a more opportune moment for reflecting on the importance of the New Struggle. Getting a second chance in life is one thing. Using it to make a better life, that’s the trick,” he said. Makgoba has previously called on the ANC to remove former President Jacob Zuma during his Christmas message last year. Makgoba says the Jacob Zuma’s administration has trampled on the values of institutions. “We cannot start over. But we can begin now to write a better ending.The past administration trampled on our institutions and values, to the point where we now live in a South Africa that has the same inequality of opportunity, inequality of healthcare, inequality of social services, inequality of education and inequality of service delivery that our
grandparents suffered.” he said.
