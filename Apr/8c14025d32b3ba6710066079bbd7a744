The new Eskom board has initiated legal action against global consulting firm McKinsey in a bid to force the company to pay back almost R1.6 billion. This after it was established that McKinsey was paid the money unlawfully and the process done without a proper contract. On Tuesday, Judge Jody Kollapen granted an order in the High Court allowing Eskom to enter an appearance in the AFU’s application to freeze McKinsey and Trillian’s assets. At the same time, McKinsey did not oppose the application and repeated it would repay the full amount to Eskom or any other government entity, should the court declare its contract with Eskom unlawful. During an Eskom inquiry, former Trillian financial advisory CEO Mosilo Mothepu told Parliament that he was unable to find work since it was found he was investigating the company on behalf of its board. “Since leaving, I have not been employed. I have had job interviews but they want to know whether I will be charged. I am also deemed a political risk,” Mothepu said. “Corporate says half their revenue is with the government. It has been 16 months. I am hopeful someone will take a chance.” Mothepu said suspended Eskom chief financial officer Anoj Singh had an improper relationship with Trillian CEO Eric Wood. -TNA Reporter
