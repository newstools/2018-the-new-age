The awards are meant to recognise Africans for their contribution in various sectors and building social cohesion amongst Africans within the continent and abroad. They are also aimed at promoting Africa through tourism and highlight the African countries where the nominees and winners come from, in an effort to put Africa where it belongs – in the global map.
