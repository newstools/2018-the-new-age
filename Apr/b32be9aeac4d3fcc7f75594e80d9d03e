THE murder case against David Ngwenya was yesterday postponed to June 28 by the Springs Magistrate’s Court for further investigation. Ngwenya appeared briefly in court for the murder of Thembisile Yende, where the public were not permitted to enter for the proceedings. “Unfortunately today nobody was permitted to enter the court auditorium except the accused, due to fears of unforeseen violence that might have broken out in the gallery,” Thembisile Yende family spokesperson Mboneni Yende said. But Mboneni maintained that members of the Thembisile Lucia Yende Foundation were peaceful and civilised citizens of the South African Republic and were not violent and just wanted to see justice being served. Eskom technician Ngwenya, who was arrested in June last year, is facing one count of premeditated murder. Yende’s decomposed body was found about 10 days after she disappeared, in a store room next to her office in Pieterboth substation in Springs, after a search for her when she was declared missing. It was only after other employees noticed a bad smell in from the corridors of the substation, where she worked, that her body was discovered. The 30-year-old Eskom employee was allegedly last seen when she went to her workplace on the evening of May 17 last year. It is believed that she was murdered because she was reportedly a whistle blower on a copper syndicate at Eskom. Preliminary post-mortem results revealed that Yende sustained head injuries and died of suffocation and had been injected with a substance. In March, family and friends and the community members held a picket outside Eskom Megawatt Park in Sunninghill demanding answers about the murder of Yende. According to media reports, Ngwenya was released on bail of R15000 last year. keitumetsim@thenewage.co.za -KEITUMETSI MOTLHALE
