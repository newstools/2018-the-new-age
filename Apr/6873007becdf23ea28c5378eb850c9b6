The South African government has called for an independent inquiry into the killing of 17 Palestinians shot down by Isreali forces last week. In a statement issued on Wednesday, International Relations and Cooperation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, on behalf of the government, condemned the incident which took place on Saturday where 17 were killed and thousands injured after taking part in a demonstration marking the 42nd anniversary of Land Day. “South Africa aligns itself with those members of the United Nations calling for an independent inquiry into the killings with a view to holding to account those who are responsible,” Sisulu said. The South African government also reiterated its support for a two-state solution in the perennial conflict between Israel and Palestine and that Israeli forces withdraw from the Gaza Strip. “South Africa maintains further that the violence on the Gaza Strip will stand in the way of rebuilding Palestinian institutions and infrastructure.” Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared a national day of mourning following the shootings, which have widely been condemned. Over 1 400 people were wounded after Israeli defense forces fired live ammunition at protesters who had gathered to commemorate the 42nd anniversary of Land Day. Land Day reflects back to 30 March 1976, when the Israeli government ordered the expropriation of Palestinian-owned land. The demonstrations against the decision led to the killing of six unarmed Palestinians. -TNA Reporter
