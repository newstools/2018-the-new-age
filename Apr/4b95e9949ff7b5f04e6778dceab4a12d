South African hip hop recording artist AKA has always had a broader vision, to maintain his longevity and brand influence beyond music and has become a pioneer in moulding and influencing the celebrity-brand engagement dynamic in Africa. The rapper recently launched Cruz Watermelon Vodka Limited Edition, the first step in an exciting journey and partnership between him and Cruz Vodka as a trend leader in the growing vodka market. In 2016, AKA successfully signed off a multimillion-rand ambassador deal with the vodka brand. Speaking to an intimate crowd in Bryanston at the weekend, AKA said: “The new Cruz Watermelon Vodka combines one of my favourite flavours with the best vodka. We’ve created something so desirable that everyone will want to drink it, whether mixing in cocktails or enjoying straight on the rocks, a truly desirable product.” AKA’s exclusive partnership with the vodka brand is the first of it’s kind in Africa, ranking on the same level as international deals for Sean Combs’ partnership with Ciroc and 50 Cents’ with Vitamin Water. A number of celebrities came out to show support, including the likes of Da L.E.S, Nomzamo Mbatha, Slikour and Pearl Thusi. @MoganeKarabo at the #cruzWatermelonAKA presser @The_New_Age @ANN7tv pic.twitter.com/msTiJ0df12 — Simangele Legodi (@MangiLegodi) April 5, 2018 @L_Tido just arrived at the #cruzWatermelonAKA presser @The_New_Age @ANN7tv pic.twitter.com/gthxsw8l55 — Simangele Legodi (@MangiLegodi) April 5, 2018 @PearlThusi and @2freshLES #cruzWatermelonAKA @The_New_Age @ANN7tv pic.twitter.com/97b0WpBJd7 — Simangele Legodi (@MangiLegodi) April 5, 2018 @NomzamoMbatha at the #cruzWatermelonAKA @The_New_Age @ANN7tv pic.twitter.com/Q2hmtOlYsW — Simangele Legodi (@MangiLegodi) April 5, 2018 @akaworldwide and @NomzamoMbatha just arrived #cruzWatermelonAKA @The_New_Age @ANN7tv pic.twitter.com/0zlcLb4XL9 — Simangele Legodi (@MangiLegodi) April 5, 2018 -Simangele Legodi
