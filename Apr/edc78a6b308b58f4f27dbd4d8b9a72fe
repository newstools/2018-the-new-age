Cosatu has expressed its distress over reports that motorists who have defaulted on paying their e-toll fees risk losing their licenses if the new Aarto Bill is passed. The Trade Unions’ national spokesperson Sizwe Pamla said that this is not only outrageous but it borders on government carelessness. He said the issue of e-tolls has nothing to do with people’s safety but has a lot to do with the privatisation of our roads and making a profit. “We will intensely oppose any attempts to use the AartoBill to go ahead with a policy that has been overwhelmingly rejected by the people of Gauteng and South Africans in general.” Palma said that Cosatu calls on Gauteng Premier David Makhura and President Cyril Ramaphosa to speedily resolve the e-toll saga once and for all. “We also call on the NCOP to send back this unreasonable bill and for President Cyril Ramaphosa not to sign it with these ridiculous clauses. “This is undermining the whole purpose of Aarto Bill, which is to change the driving culture of South Africans.” The trade union said that this policy that has been rejected by the ANC structures and alliance partners is still being smuggled into legislation. -TNA reporter
