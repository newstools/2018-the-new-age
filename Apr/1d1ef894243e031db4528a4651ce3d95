The University of Johannesburg will on Monday acknowledge international icon and Ndebele artist Esther Nikwambi Mahlangu with an honorary doctoral degree. Mahlangu is the third recipient of an honorary doctorate conferred by the University during this year’s Autumn graduation season, following Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng and Prof Robert Fry Engle. She began painting at the age of 10, learning the art of Ndebele homestead wall painting and beadwork from her mother and grandmother. Her work came to international attention in 1989, following her inclusion on the exhibition ‘Magiciens de la Terre’ that took place at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. The Executive Dean of the Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture Professor Federico Freschi said with this honorary doctorate, the University recognises Mahlangu for her legacy as a cultural entrepreneur, skilfully negotiating local and global worlds, and as an educator. “Indeed as a visionary individual she has traversed what to others is an insurmountable political barrier. “In the context of current debates in South African institutions of higher learning on questions of decolonisation of the curriculum, Mahlangu is a living example of how authentic African knowledge systems can be articulated meaningfully and sustainably. In her, we have an icon worthy of being looked up to by the next generation of creatives and the University.” -TNA Reporter
