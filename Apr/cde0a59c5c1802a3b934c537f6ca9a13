The government has announced on Thursday that it has placed the ailing North West provincial department of health under the administration. This was revealed by Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane while briefing the media on the outcomes of the Cabinet meeting held on Wednesday. Mokonyane said that Cabinet decided to invoked Section 100 (1) (b) of the Constitution which empowers the government to intervene in the administration of the province. “What has been a revealing area that requires intervention is around health services because of the stand-off between management, labour and leadership in that sector We will have to deal with the inefficiencies which have brought some of the clinics and hospitals to a close,” she said. She added that the immediate objectives of the intervention would be to restore trust and confidence between labour and government as well as to assist the province to upgrade its systems and capabilities to a new normality. The intervention comes after an ailing public health which has been made worse by recent protest in the province calling for Premier Supra Mahumapelo to resign. Cabinet has also put together a ministerial task team to handle the unfolding situation in the North West led by Minister in the Presidency, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma.
