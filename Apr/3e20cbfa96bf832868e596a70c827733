The University of the Witwatersrand has expressed its condolences to the Madikizela and Mandela family following the passing of Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. The struggle veteran passed away at the age of 81 in Johannesburg, Netcare Milpark Hospital after a long illness. The university has described the ‘mother of the nation’ as someone who never hesitated to speak her mind. “An activist and a leader at the forefront of the struggle for freedom, Mama Madikizela-Mandela did not hesitate to speak her mind and to sacrifice her personal freedoms and her family, in the quest for the freedom and liberation of South Africans from Apartheid.” Madikizela-Mandela was married to former President and anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela in 1957 with whom she had two children. The university said that Madikizela-Mandela was a political stalwart in her own right. She was also an alumnus of the University of the Witwatersrand. Wits say that Madikizela-Mandela had given of herself in the fight for gender equity and social justice. Meanwhile, the University of Johannesburg (UJ) said that her contribution to South African political and cultural life has captured the imagination of the world. “As a political stalwart, her activism and resistance demonstrated her commitment to the struggle against inequalities, unemployment and poverty.Mama Winnie never tired of giving her time,” UJ said. The university urged South Africans to honour her memory and “pick up where she left off and continue to transform our society. Her superb dedication and resolve shall eternally be etched in our collective memory”. -TNA Reporter
