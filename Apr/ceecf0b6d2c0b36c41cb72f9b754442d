The government has announced that it will deploy a team of ministers to the North West to interact with residents in order to establish what led to the violent protest that took place in the past few days, this is according to Communication’s Minister Nomvula Mokonyane. Mokonyane confirmed the news on Thursday while addressing the media at Tshedimosetso house in Pretoria on the outcomes of Wednesday’s cabinet briefing. The team of Ministers is expected to give feedback to the cabinet in the next two weeks. “This team is not engaging the Premier on him resigning. It’s engaging on the state of governance, the issues facing the provincial government and it will then bring all those issues to the cabinet in the next two weeks,” she said. The intervention follows violent protest embarked on by Mahikeng residents in their bid to oust Supra Mahumapelo as the provincial premier. Residents have accused Mahumapelo of corruption and improperly benefitting his family and close friends. Mokonyane also said that other processes within the African National Congress are currently seized with dealing with the matter. There are already interactions that have happened at the level of the President and Premier of the North-West. Meanwhile, Mahumapelo says people who are sponsoring these protest are part of an anti-Supra coalition seeking to derail the radical approach of changing the economic landscape of the province. “I am not saying there are no challenges in Mahikeng, but there are people who are making sure that all this radical approach to changing the economic landscape of the province doesn’t happen. “Also since I announce the aggressive programme to deal with corruption since 1994 until now, people have just decided to stand up and fight that programme.” -TNA Reporter
