As South Africans continue with a 10-day mourning period in honour of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule will on Monday launch a wall of remembrance. Madikizela-Mandela passed away on Monday 2 April following a long illness. Over the coming days, the party will hold several provincial memorial services in seven provinces and one national memorial service in Mbizana in the Eastern Cape. ANC members and supporters will have an opportunity to write their condolences on the wall of remembrance at the party’s headquarters in Johannesburg. “Ours is not only to eulogise Mama Winnie but to draw the much-needed lessons from such a selfless, courageous and ever patriotic leader,” ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said on Sunday. Deputy President David Mabuza will on Monday address mourners at the Limpopo memorial service, which will be held at Jack Botes Hall in Polokwane at 1pm. Magashule will address Gauteng mourners at the University of Johannesburg’s Soweto Campus at 3pm. ANC Treasure-General Paul Mashatile will be at the Steve Tshwete Banquet Hall in Middleberg, Mpumalanga at 2pm. In the North West, ANC NEC member Obed Bapela addressed mourners and party supporters at the Mahikeng Civic Centre at 9am. A service will be held at the Mittah Seperepere Convention Centre in the Northern Cape as well. Mabuza is also expected to address mourners at the KwaZulu-Natal memorial service, which will be held at Durban City Hall on Thursday at 3pm. -TNA Reporter
