The Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) said that it will be forging ahead with the nationwide planned strike on Wednesday in protest against the proposed amendments to Labour laws. “We are forging ahead with the mass mobilisation of workers on the 25th. A nationwide general strike and marches throughout the country, to protest against the proposed poverty-level NMW of R20 an hour and amendments Labour lawsto labour laws which will destroy workers constitutional right to strike,” said Saftu. The union says that it demands the Department of Labour to ‘not just tinker with the details’ of the proposed Bill but for it to make fundamental changes to make minimum wage become a living wage. “We will not be marching this time, we are occupying the Johannesburg city. You will see no less than 100 thousand of workers in the streets of Johannesburg defending their right to strike,” Saftu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi said. He said that they will also be protesting against the proposal that seeks to prevent workers to embark on a protected strike in future. “They put up four stumbling blocks, sure way of ensuring that no union will be able to call for a strike.” Vavi said that they are also putting pressure on government and political parties to defend the rights of workers. -TNA Reporter
