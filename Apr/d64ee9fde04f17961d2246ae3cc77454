The Saps management and the State Information Technology Agency (SITA) have confirmed that certain systems within the Saps have been shut down. The police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said that while the shutting down of the said systems is likely to affect the efficiency of certain operations within the Saps, however, they do not completely bring the operations to a halt. “To ensure that operations can continue unhindered and that service delivery is not compromised, contingency plans have been put in place.” In the meantime, both the police and SITA are seeking legal advice on this matter and have promised to act accordingly. “We will not be giving out specifics, given that there are serious security implications and that we may potentially need to act on the legal advice if necessary.” -TNA Reporter
