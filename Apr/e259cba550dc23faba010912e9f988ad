The wage talks between bus drivers and their employees collapsed yet again late last night despite the intervention of Minister of Labour Mildred Oliphant. Last nights collapsed follows last week collapsed at the bargaining council resulting in further action to intensify the strike by seeking non-striking workers to join to force the employers’ hand. SATAWU spokesperson Zanele Sabela confirmed during a radio interview that talks did collapsed last night despite minister’s intervention. “Talks collapsed again last night, even after the intervention by Labour Minister Mildred Olifant.” It is reported that Unions rejected an 8.5% increase and 9% increase at the weekend. The minister intervention comes after a strike entered its seventh day as workers protest over wages and better working conditions. Workers initially demanded a 12% increase while the employer was offering a 7% increase. On Tuesday, Sabela said that they will be meeting the department on Tuesday with expectations of a difficult encounter. However, hoped that the meeting will “come out with something”. “If past behaviour is any indication of future behaviour, we are not expecting a walk in the park.” Beyond the salary increases, the bus operators have grievances with the compensation of secondary drivers who are not being paid meanwhile they are making the trip. -TNA Reporter
