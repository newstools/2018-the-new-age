EFF chairperson Dali Mpofu has praised late former ANC NEC member and Minister of Social Development Zola Skweyiya for sacrificing his life for the total emancipation of South Africa. Mpofu also paid tribute to late former South African ambassador to Nigeria and Switzerland George Nene, who died last week. He was speaking during a memorial service, organised by the EFF, for the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in Brandfort in the Free State, few metres from where Madikizela-Mandela was banished to in 1977. Mpofu said it was through their commitment to justice and their love for the people that they heeded a call to pick up their arms and fight the racist apartheid regime. “Comrades let us all stand up and observe a moment of silence for the gallant comrade Zola Skweyiya who lost his life this morning. He will be dearly missed,” Mpofu said. Skweyiya died on Wednesday morning at a hospital in Pretoria. Nene will be buried at Avalon Cemetary in Soweto on Friday. -TNA Reporter
