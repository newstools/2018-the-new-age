Two men are due to appear in the Uitenhage Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday on charges of possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition.  The suspects aged 29 and 34 were arrested on Sunday following a complaint of a suspicious vehicle which led to the recovery of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition.  It is alleged that on Sunday, police responded to a complaint of a suspicious vehicle parked near a 24-hour fuel station in Main Street, Despatch.  Sergeant Majola Nkohli said “Upon arrival at the scene, police found an unlicensed firearm with one live round of ammunition hidden behind the passenger seat. The two men and also the vehicle was impounded for further investigation.  “A preliminary investigation has revealed that the recovered firearm, a 7.65mm pistol, was stolen in June last year in Worcester, Western Cape. Several forensic tests are to be conducted to possibly link the two men with other pending robbery cases”, said Nkohli.  Uitenhage Acting Cluster Commander, Brigadier Ronald Koll commended the community of Despatch for their alertness. “Ever since the robbery of a bakery business two months ago, there is an increase in the number of complaints that police are receiving from Despatch ranging from suspicious persons to suspicious vehicles, that proves that residents are heeding police’s call to play a part in the fight against crime. I also commend the quick response from the members, who attended to a complaint”, added Brig Koll. -TNA Reporter
