While the rest of the country celebrates National Freedom Day a tragic collision between a bakkie and a train on the Buttskop level crossing in Cape Town has claimed the lives of seven people. According to Western Cape traffic chief, Kenny Africa, the accident occurred in the early hours of Friday morning while a bakkie was transporting several passengers on their way to work. ” Apparently the bakkie got in front of the train, on the level crossing earlier this morning leaving seven people dead. According to the eye-witness on the scene, the cause appears to be human error,” said Africa. South African Police Service members are currently on the scene, to begin with, their investigation. The Buttskop level crossing gained infamy when in 2010 taxi driver Jacob Humphreys ignored safety signals at the crossing and collided with a train leading to the death of 10 school children. Meanwhile, City of Cape Town traffic services spokesperson, Richard Coleman said that the crossing is currently is closed to all traffic due to the gruesome accident. ” The routes affected are mainly the Buttskop road which is closed at Van Reebeck Road and is also closed at Range Road. We are allowing no traffic towards that level crossing while the SAPS is busy with its investigation,” he said. –TNA Reporter
