Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba will be approaching the Constitutional Court in order to fight for his job and overturn a North Gauteng High Court ruling that declared him a liar. In February, the North Gauteng High Court ruled that Gigaba lied under oath during his testimony in a case brought by Fireblade Aviation about the opening of a private immigration terminal at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg. The company, which is owned by the wealthy Oppenheimer family, filed a lawsuit against Gigaba in which it alleged that he had reneged on a pledge he made to the company during his first stint as Home Affairs minister in 2016, to delegate home affairs officials to facilitate custom services at a facility that was going to be developed on a piece of land owned by Denel, near the airport. Gigaba’s job is also under threat after President Cyril Ramaphosa previously said it was concerning that the High Court found that Gigaba lied under oath and that he was giving the matter “due and proper consideration”. Earlier this year, the Constitutional Court refused to listen to Gigaba’s appeal, saying it must first go through the appeals court. -TNA Reporter
