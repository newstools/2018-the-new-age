ANC in KwaZulu-Natal and the North West have hailed the late party leader Winnie Madikizela Mandela and described her passing as “marking the end of an era of comrades of her calibre and generation, who lived through the most challenging times of our beloved organisation, the ANC, and the country”. KZN ANC described Madikizela-Mandela as an embodiment of defiance against the unjust and brutal apartheid regime, who was prepared to lay down her life to ensure that we attained our freedom while North West ANC described her as “an undisputed icon of the struggle for the liberation of South Africa and gender emancipation”. Madikizela-Mandela died on Monday after a long illness. North West Acting Provincial Secretary Suzan Dantjie said Mama Winnie’s death has left a vacuum in the struggle to construct a united, democratic, non-racial, non-sexist and prosperous South African society. “We will, however, hold onto and continue with her teachings of putting the country and the people first, the teachings she continued to share even as late as this year, despite her health challenges,” Dantjie said. KZN interim provincial committee coordinator Sihle Zikalala said the mother of the nation, as Mama Winnie was affectionately known as an embodiment of defiance against the brutal apartheid regime who was also prepared to lay down her own life in order to ensure that freedom was attained. “She also never shied away from confronting challenges facing our movement until her passing, in her pursuit of unity within our ranks. “Our movement has lost one of its dedicated freedom fighters, a disciplined veteran, and a true revolutionary, who sacrificed her youth and risked her life for the liberation of South Africa. “Madikizela-Mandela knew and lived for the ANC until her last day. She risked her life fighting for all South Africans to be free from the evil apartheid regime,” Zikalala said. -TNA Reporter
