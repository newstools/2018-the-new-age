A CHANGE to Parliament’s programme for this week will see Deputy President David Mabuza answering questions in the National Assembly on Wednesday instead of Thursday. Mabuza facing Members of Parliament in what can be called political jousting will be the standout Parliamentary event of the week. He is due to answer six questions, three from the ANC and three from opposition parties. Because Friday is a Public Holiday Parliament’s committees will not sit on that day. But tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday will be the usual working days for Portfolio Committees. Most of the Portfolio Committees will be listening to various departments presenting their annual performance plans, but state capture and some of the activities of the Gupta family will be on the agenda of two different Portfolio Committees tomorrow and Wednesday. Tomorrow the standing committee on public accounts will cast an inquiring eye of the national carrier, South African Airways and examine irregular, wasteful and fruitless expenditure. Terms for an inquiry into the naturalisation of members of the Gupta family will be determined at a meeting of the Home Affairs Portfolio committee tomorrow. On Wednesday, the mineral resources and portfolio committee will meet to discuss the terms of references and witnesses for its probe into state capture involving the former minister Mosebenzi Zwane. news@thenewage.co.za -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
