DESPITE Platinum Stars looking as good as relegated from the Premier Soccer League, there are some who are still keeping the faith. Stars utility player Enocent Mkhabela said Dikwena should not give up the fight, but rather focus on amassing as many points as possible in their remaining matches. With just three outings to go in the season, Roger de Sa’s side remain rooted at the bottom of the Absa Premiership table with 21 points. “What I believe is that it is not over until it’s over. I believe we can make it. There’s still a chance. Nine points can make a big difference. “We have to focus on our game plan. Anything is possible if we can only win our remaining games,” he said. Mkhabela, who plays as a defender and midfielder, said Dikwena should focus on garnering maximum points at the expense of AmaZulu, whom they host at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium tonight. “Amazulu want to make the top eight so it’s not going to be easy. We must not focus on them too much. We must focus on our plan and be positive. “If we can pull together in the same direction we can make it. We need to take our chances. We need to apply ourselves well,” Mkhabela said. Dikwena have found it hard when it comes to scoring and Mkhabela said more needs to be done. “Before you score, you must create chances. We don’t create enough chances. We must create chances to give our strikers opportunities to score. “We do play well but when we get to the final third we don’t do that well. If we can create more chances we can score. We will fight until the final whistle and make sure that we win all our games.” -TNA REPORTER|sports@tnamedia.co.za
