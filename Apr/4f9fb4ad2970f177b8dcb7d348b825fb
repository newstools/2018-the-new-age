Former President Jacob Zuma has reiterated the seriousness of land ownership saying that the issue of land was more than just a political matter – rather a matter of ‘life and death”. “The matter we are talking about is not just another political matter, to us it a life and death question. You talk about inequality, you talk about poverty, you talk about unemployment, it all emanates from the land question,” said Zuma The former President was speaking at the Blacks-only dialogue project that was hosted by Black First Land First (BLF) on Saturday to address issues concerning land. Zuma said that the land issue was not just a political battle but a basis to address issues of unemployment. Zuma said the people could have political power, but if they lacked, economic power and security, ” that political power will be eroded with time.” “The land question is by no doubt the biggest hill of our democracy, it must always be emphasized that the struggle against colonialism and later apartheid centred on the land question, which failed to find adequate expression towards a solution in the 24 years of our democracy. Until this question is resolved to the benefit of the African majority, our development and the battle against poverty, unemployment and inequality will remain elusive,” Zuma said. -TNA Reporter
