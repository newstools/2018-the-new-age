Two suspects are expected to appear in the Ganyesa Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday on two counts of murder, four of attempted murder, car-hijacking, business robbery, illegal possession of firearm and ammunition, kidnapping and rape. The suspects were arrested on Sunday after they allegedly shot and killed two men in the Ganyesa village outside Vryburg. Lieutenant-Colonel Amanda Funani said: “It is alleged that the suspects tried to rob a group of women who were from a local tavern and the two men tried to assist the women when they were shot by the suspects. The suspects allegedly kidnapped one of the women, 23 and fled the scene. The woman was allegedly raped by one of the suspects.” Preliminary investigations revealed that the pair is linked to other cases of business robbery and attempted murder allegedly committed in Morokweng. “They are also linked with a car-hijacking and attempted murder cases that were reported in Mooinooi on 30 March.” North West acting Provincial Commissioner Major-General Ryno Naidoo commended the police for their quick response that led to the arrest of the suspects. -TNA Reporter
