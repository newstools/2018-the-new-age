Imperial Holdings Limited has on Wednesday announced the resignation of its CEO Mark Lamberti which will take effect from 30 April. Lamberti has been under fire since the High Court found him guilty of discrimination after ruling that he had violated the dignity of charted accountant Adila Chowan, a former Imperial employee, by saying that she was a candidate of female employment equity. According to a statement issued by Imperials board, its current Group Chief Financial Officer, Osman Arbee will take over the reigns from Lamberti on 1 May. According to the board, Lamberti has resigned in the best interests of the company and its stakeholders to shield them from the impacts of the negative coverage since the scandal broke. “The board has noted the content and tone of the judgement in which there is no finding of defamation, racism or sexism despite extensive and frequently inaccurate publicity directed at Mr Lamberti suggesting that there was.” Related: Lamberti’s bigotry exposes slow pace of transformation The imperial board further said that it had studied and accepts the judgement and would implement action to address “deficiencies” in its gender and race relations highlighted by the judgement. Earlier this month Lamberti resigned as a board member at power utility Eskom. -Siphiwe Mchunu
