Auditing firm Nkonki has voluntarily decided to liquidate its Sunninghill, Johannesburg operation after the office of the Auditor-General announced that it will be terminating all government audits done by the company. Last week, Auditor-General Kimi Makwethu, announced that government would no longer be using the services of the two auditing companies Nkonki and KPMG after the two were embroiled in scandals involving the Gupta family. Earlier this month, the company’s CEO Mitesh Patel resigned from his position after Amabungane reported that his R107 million management buyout of the company was funded by controversial Gupta associate Salim Essa through his Trillian Capital. Amabungane further reported that the reason Patel was given the money was to ensure that he holds most of the 65% of Nkonki as a front for his funders after the company was awarded a deal by Eskom. Nkonki issued a through the law firm Nicqui Galaktiou Incorporated said the company had no option but to cease its operations after 25 years of service. “The 180 employees are victims who had no involvement nor knowledge in the shareholding and loan transactions, the funding thereof nor the due diligence processes that were conducted,” it said in a statement. Nkonki said it was regrettable that the Auditor-General terminated its public sector contract despite the company undergoing the process of purchasing Patel’s shareholding of the company, adding that this will make it difficult to finalise the buying back of the shares. -TNA Reporter
