Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Sport and Recreation said on Tuesday that it will summon the PSL to answer for the violence and chaos that erupted at the Moses Mabhida Stadium last Saturday. This comes after fans stormed into the field, set fire on stadium seats and vandalised stadium properly after Kaizer Chiefs lost to Free State Stars during the Nedbank cup semi finals. The committee’s chairperson, Beauty Dlulane said that the behaviour expressed by the fans at the stadium should not be tolerated. “We all agreed that we need to call the PSL. Yesterday I saw Mr khoza issuing a statement condemning this thing, to us, it can’t be like that. We want them to come and tell us because we were thinking whenever matches are going to happen in every stadium, the PSL was supposed to seat with the management, the security and the SAPS. “Especially that these big clubs have been culprits when they are losing, something like this is happening. Even if it is not after the match, the stampede is always there,” she said. Dlulane said that this happens while the committee was still waiting for SAFA to present the report on what actions it extends to take on the matter. “Before we get that, from last year the same things are happening,” she said. The incident led to an unformed number of people injured while a male security guard who was captured on camera being assaulted by a group of fans sustained serious injuries. Dlulane said that she was not confident that the PSL was managing the matches in big stadiums properly. She said that the committee would call for a harsher sentence on those responsible for the vandalism at the stadium. “They must be banned in stadiums.” -TNA Reporter
