Trade union Cosatu has distanced itself from the general strike organised by its rival South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) against the implementation of the national minimum wage of R20 per hour and other muted changes to the Labour Relations Act. Cosatu said it is concerned about the misleading statements by some leaders of Saftu, who were claiming the federation would join the strike which is scheduled for Wednesday, April 25. Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla said it is important for the federation to come out and distance itself from the planned strike. “We want to make it clear that this is totally not true and Cosatu is not part of the planned strike. We condemn the mischievous attempt to confuse our members by Saftu.” Pamla said the federation has always been in support of a minimum wage bill, therefore it would not make sense for Cosatu to associate with the planned strike. “The minimum wage will be a huge achievement that will see wages rise for the 47% of workers (6 million), who earn less than R20 an hour currently. “This represents the foundation that will help us built towards the goal of a living wage.” He said the federation sees Wednesday’s strike as nothing else but a fabrication, misrepresentation and outlandish conspiracy theories by Saftu and its affiliates. -TNA Reporter
