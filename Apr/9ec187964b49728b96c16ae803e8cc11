Eva Longoria, best known for her role in the TV series “Desperate Housewives,” got a star on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame on Monday, in an event hailed by the Latino community. “Representation matters. So every time there’s another Latino on this Walk of Fame, it’s another win for a whole community,” the 43-year-old actress from a Texas family tracing its roots to Mexico told AFP. Longoria received the honor in the presence of her husband, former Televisa chairman Jose Baston. They are expecting their first child in May. Celebrities such as Ricky Martin, Victoria Beckham and actresses Felicity Huffman and Anna Faris also attended the ceremony. “It’s really important for me to be here, for people to come and see the star, and know that you can do it with a lot of hard work,” said Longoria. In the romantic comedy “Overboard,” set for release next month, Longoria plays the best friend of a single mother struggling to make ends meet. -AFP
