The father who allegedly threw his child off the roof of a shack in the Eastern Cape will appear in the New Brighton Magistrate’s Court on a charge of attempted murder on Monday. According to police, the 38-year-old father allegedly climbed onto the roof with the little girl, where he attempted to throw her off, as police swept in to remove illegal shack dwellers in the area.
