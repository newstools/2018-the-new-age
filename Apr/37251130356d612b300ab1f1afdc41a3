Bus companies and transport union representatives are meeting in a closed session in a bid to resolve a salary dispute that has caused a nationwide bus strike. Drivers from different unions are demanding a 12% salary increase, while the employer willing to give a 7% increase. Among the drivers, demands are working hours and equal pay for dual drivers.
