CIVIL society group Black Caucus yesterday joined the South African Natives Forum in calling for the axing of Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom. On Saturday, Hanekom tweeted that he couldn’t wait for the closure of news station ANN7. In a statement, the forum said it noted a social media post by Hanekom and was disturbed that the minister was discriminating not only against the channel but against employees and viewers on the grounds of race, conscience and belief. “The minister is completely undermining and insulting section 9 of the Bill of Rights, which calls for equality of all before the state,” the forum said. In addition, it said that even if he were tweeting in his personal capacity, such views have no business in government representatives. “The minister then goes further to discriminate against the former president Jacob Zuma by insinuating that he should not be given a platform to express his views and opinions and that he should be treated like a criminal.” Black Caucus joined the fray yesterday, calling for the immediate axing of Hanekom. The group said it called on the ANC NEC to “rid itself of Hanekom”. “Hanekom’s comments are not only racist but are inconsiderate of the employees of ANN7. Hanekom was seen cosy with a certain journalist who has consistently written badly of the ANC and the ANC failed to discipline him. “Now he is trying to deter the former president of the ANC from speaking in public. That is out of line,” the statement said. Hanekom was not available for comment yesterday. hlonim@thenewage.co.za -HLONI MASHIGO
