A father who was captured on a video throwing his six-month-old daughter from the roof of his shack at an informal settlement in Port Elizabeth will today appear in court. The 38-year-old father from Joe Slovo informal settlement will appear at the New Brighton Magistrates court to face a charge of child abuse after it was changed from attempted murder pending further evidence and investigation prior to his appearance last week. He was allegedly used the toddler as a shield to delay the police from demolishing shacks which were illegally constructed on municipality land. More than 80 shacks, including the accused’s’ were demolished by the police. Metro police Constable Luyolo Nojulumba was hailed as a hero after he caught the baby, potentially saving her life. Last week, the prosecution requested for a postponement in order to verify the father’s address before he can apply for bail. -TNA Reporter
