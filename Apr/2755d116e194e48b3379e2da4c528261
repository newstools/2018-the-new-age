THE return of kwaito musician and convicted rapist Sipho “Brickz” Ndlovu to the stage has set tongues wagging after the star made his first public performance following his R80000 bail just more than two weeks ago. Poet Ntsiki Mazwai who claims to be a victim of rape by the musician and scores of social media users were among the first to voice their disapproval. On Thursday, the Sweety My Baby hitmaker took to the Mega Music stage, formerly Bassline, where he performed for the first time in more than six months. A Facebook user by the name of Mmulelantlu More, said: “Wait guys, How is Brickz out performing at a club and people screaming and cheering for him. Ninjani kanti nina (what’s wrong with you).” After Umhlobo Wenene radio station played his song on Siphiwo Nzawumbi’s show, Ntsiki Mazwai went on to confront the presenter on why they were promoting a convicted rapist’s music. “It’s sad when presenters have no sense of what is right,” she said. “I’m so disappointed in you Spich you know better.” Nzawumbi hit back and said he was not an activist but a broadcaster. Mazwai said: “I am extremely disappointed at how society praises rapists. Why do we insist on celebrating someone who was convicted of such a terrible crime. This hurts me because I am one of his victims and I’ve been receiving some hate from society ever since I opened up about my ordeal.” -NONTOKOZO GXUMISA AND DIKELEDI MOLOBELA news@thenewage.co.za
