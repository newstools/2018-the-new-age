City of Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille is in hot water for attending the Winnie Madikizela-Mandela memorial service organised by the EFF on Wednesday. DA Federal Chairperson James Selfe said there would be a time where members would be allowed to speak at other party rallies but they would not do so without consulting the DA. De Lille’s attendance fueled more tension between herself and the DA. Earlier this year, the mayor was subjected to a motion of no confidence brought by her own party, which she survived by one vote. The party later accused her of misrepresenting and spread alternative facts relating to her disciplinary hearing. At the time, Selfe said de Lille’s statement that nothing much had happened in the 30 days after the referral of substantive issues pertaining to her conduct to the Federal Legal Commission (FLC), was simply untrue. “The matter was referred to the FLC on 16 January. In the first 30 days there was a lot of back and forth between the commission and de Lille’s lawyers and the matter has been treated with the urgency it deserves,” Selfe said. -TNA Reporter
