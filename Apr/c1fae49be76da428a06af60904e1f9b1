The Chairperson of Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Health Mary-Ann Dunjwa says that the committee has never received a letter from a group of concerned medical professionals as it has been reported in the papers on Sunday. In an article carried by the City Press, the medical practitioners are alleged to have written to Dunjwa to raise concerns over the “victimisation” of black candidates who are aspiring to specialise in obstetrics and gynaecology. According to the report, the letter also raised the medical professional’s concerns about the failure rate of black candidates. The paper is alleging that the mentioned letter written to the committee followed the removal of a black medical professor from examiners panel on allegations of leaking final questions in a gynaecology module exam. “I never received a letter from a group of concerned medical professionals, furthermore no individual medical professional talked to me on behalf of a collective of medical professionals on the allegations mentioned in the article. “I find this as a shoddy and unethical journalism. I deserved to be consulted before this claim could be published carrying my name and identity,” said Dunjwa Dunjwa said that she also finds it shocking to see her name and her photograph in a newspaper without her side of the story to establish the authenticity of the claim that she received a letter before the article could be published. -TNA Reporter
