Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has requested more time from President Cyril Ramaphosa, to complete an investigation into a complaint that Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba lied under oath and violated the Constitution. The complaint had been laid by DA member of Parliament John Steenhuisen following a ruling by the High Court in February. The High Court ruled that Gigaba had lied under oath while giving testimony during his initial tenure as Home Affairs Minister, in a case filed by an aviation company that wanted to operate a private immigration terminal at  OR Tambo airport in Johannesburg. @PublicProtector takes time to write to President and Gigaba that she needs more time to complete investigation into my complaint against Gigaba( who knows why,it’s clear from the court papers)As the complainant I of course had to find this out from the media.Hardly professional! — John Steenhuisen MP (@jsteenhuisen) April 11, 2018  Steenhuisen submitted the complaint in February and the Public Protector was expected to have completed her investigations in a month. The case is in relation to an application by an aviation company called Fireblade Aviation, which is owned by the Oppenheimer family, which compelled Gigaba to stick by a decision he had initially taken to grant the company’s application to operate at OR Tambo airport, which he later changed. Mkhwebane said that this investigation is still underway. The correspondence to the President is a requirement in terms of the Executive Member’s Ethics Act, 1998. The letter to the Minister was putting the allegations to him for a response. The investigation is underway. There is nothing to report yet. https://t.co/dtVeELr2rd — Public Protector SA (@PublicProtector) April 11, 2018  -TNA Reporter
