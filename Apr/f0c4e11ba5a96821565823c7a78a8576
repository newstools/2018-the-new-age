The The National Interfaith Council of South Africa (NICSA) and the Commission for Religious Affairs (CRA) will on Wednesday announce several activities they will be hosting before and during former President Jacob Zuma’s court appearance. Zuma is expected to appear in the Durban High Court on Friday to face corruption, racketeering and money laundering charges after they were reinstated by National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Shaun Abrahams. Spokesperson for the two religious bodies Bishop Vusi Dube said religion’s role in the fight against apartheid was well-known and it was a known fact that it played a critical role in campaigns that toppled the regime. “It, therefore, remains the responsibility of the religious sector to caution all South Africans about the dangerous efforts seeking to destroy the gains of democracy,” Dube said. Dube said as religious leaders, they strongly disagreed with the NPA’s decision to recharge Zuma. “We say hands off Jacob Zuma.” The event is scheduled to take place at the Ethekwini Community Church on 181 Anton Lembede Street on Wednesday. -TNA Reporter
