City of Johannesburg Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba and Community Safety MMC Michael Sun on Monday praised the city’s Metro Police officers and the police for the arrest of two people in connection with the killing of a Metro Police officer. Metro Police officer DA Ratshikhopha was shot and killed in February while trying to stop a minibus which was stolen in Booysens. After his killing, Mashaba offered a R100 000 reward for information that could lead to the arrest and conviction of the people responsible for his death. The suspects were arrested after the Department of Community Safety passed on information it had received, to the SAPS, on the murder. The SAPS arrested two suspects at Zola Extension 10 in Soweto during a joint operation. Sun thanked community members who provided the police with the information. “I wish to thank the member of the public who provided us with this information and commend the Johannesburg Central SAPS cetectives and JMPD for making this breakthrough. I also thank the Lenasia CPF members and MNH security for assisting with the joint operation,” Sun said. The police are hoping to arrest a third suspect who is still at large. “I wish to state unreservedly that we will hunt down every suspect who is involved in the attacks or killings of our police and EMS officers. Our Department of Public Safety together with JMPD chief David Tembe will not rest until these criminals are caught and receive the harshest prison sentences for their heinous crimes.” The suspects are expected to appear in court soon. -TNA Reporter
