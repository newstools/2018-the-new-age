INDEPENDENT Media yesterday denied a media report by a journalist of investigative unit amaBhungane which questioned the prelisting statement of the company, insisting the report was inaccurate. It said the article did not place the context for the reader to understand the bigger picture. In the media report amaBhungane said that the listing of Sagarmatha was a desperate attempt to save Independent, which would be incorporated into Sagarmatha if the private placement attracted enough money. “Iqbal Survé, controlling Independent, is seeking to raise a minimum of R3bn via this private placement despite the fact that the company he’s selling is technically insolvent and labouring under the burden of some R2,3bn in debt” the report said. Independent Media yesterday disputed this narrative and insisted that the article was off the mark and attempted yesterday to set the record straight on the matter. “Independent Media makes up less than 5% of the Sagarmatha Technologies value proposition. “The investment into Independent Media is a private equity transaction,” the company said. “The other reality is that all media houses are battling with declining revenues. That’s not a secret either. “The difference here is that Independent Media has jumped on the supergalactic highway and has managed to re-engineer itself to take advantage of technology and the fourth industrial revolution,” it said. Sagarmatha Technologies is scheduled to list in the Broadcast and Entertainment sub-sector of the JSE’s main board and is expected to take place on Friday. -THELMA NGOMA|thelman@thenewage.co.za
