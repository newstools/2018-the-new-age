A number of organizations supporting former President Jacob Zuma will hold a night vigil ahead of his court appearance at the Durban High Court on Friday. Nkosentsha Shezi of the National Funeral Practitioners Association of South Africa (Nafupa) said that students from the Durban University and some business organizations will be joining in the march in support of Zuma. “The RET champion which is a combination of business forums have joined together to say that they are standing 100% behind the former President Jacob Zuma. Indeed we are organising a night vigil,” Shezi said. He said that the march would also be joined in by civil society organisations. “But we organizing everybody to come on the 6th at Orta park in Durban, we’re going to have the biggest march ever seen,” he said. Shezi said that they were supporting the former President on the work that he has done during his tenure on the introduction of Radical Economic Transformation. The former president will be appearing at the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Durban on Friday on the 16 charges of corruption, money laundering, fraud and racketeering in relation to the arms deal. These charges were recently reinstated by the NPA. Last month, ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule announced that the party had resolved that those pledging to support Zuma or other members facing criminal charges can do so ‘in their individual capacity’ and not as representatives of the party. -TNA Reporter
