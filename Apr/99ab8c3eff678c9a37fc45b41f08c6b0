TWO Mangaung men were on Friday sentenced to life in prison for the rape of a 21-year-old woman. Police spokesperson Sgt Ikobeng Hlubi said the men, Teboho Nhole, 27, and Lebohang Mokhethi, 25, in October, 6, 2015 entered a home where the then 21-year-old woman was visiting his cousin at Kgotsong Location in Bloemfontein. They started a fight with the cousin and the victim and then forcefully took her to their shack where they took turns raping her throughout the night. Hlubi said the accused only let her go in the morning and she immediately reported the matter to the family who reported the incident to the police. Nhole was arrested three months after the rape and Mokhethi was arrested after more than a year of searching. This is after he was identified by a witness during a case. “Both suspects were charged with kidnapping and rape, they were found guilty on both charges and as a result, they were sentenced to six years in prison for kidnapping and sentenced to life for rape,” Hlubi said. Commissioner Lt-Gen Moeketsi Sempe said these sentences would go a long way in asserting the authority of the state and boosting the confidence of South Africans in the criminal justice system. “I salute all those who were involved in the value chain of bringing the perpetrators to book, starting with the SAPS members who attended the crime scene taking the statement of the victim, the investigating officer, the medical practitioner who examined the victim, all witnesses who testified without fear, the prosecutor who dealt with this case in a distinguishable manner and the magistrate who presided objectively without any fear or favour,” Sempe said. He further said the sentence should send a strong message to those who thought of violating women and children. “We are on a journey to a safer South Africa,” he said. michaelt@thenewage.co.za -MICHAEL TLHAKUDI
