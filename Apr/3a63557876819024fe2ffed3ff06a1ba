The embattled former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe is given until Friday to repay the R11m pension fund he received from the utility. This comes after he lost his appeal against an earlier judgment which sought to force him to pay back part of his pension. Early this year, the North Gauteng High Court described the transaction between Eskom and Molefe as a ‘deliberate scheme’ concocted after he resigned from the utility in 2016. The court further ruled that Molefe was not entitled to the benefits as he had been employed by Eskom for only 18 months. Meanwhile, Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomed the dismissal of his application on Tuesday, saying that Molefe had no prospects of winning the case. “It was clear to the DA that Mr Molefe’s preposterous application had no chance of success and the court was entirely correct to dismiss it,” the DA said. The DA added that he was not entitled to the ‘extravagant pension benefits’ that he had been offered ‘whether R11 million or more’. “Molefe’s insistence that his return to Eskom was not a reinstatement but a continuation of his contract is completely fictional.” According to reports, Trade Union solidarity representative Van der Bijl confirmed to Business Day that former Eskom CEO had until Friday 11 am to repay the money. He said they still maintained that the payment was not only unlawful but also one for which Molefe could be criminally prosecuted. Van der Bijl said Solidarity’s legal costs, which Molefe would have to cover, could be up to R1m. -TNA Reporter
