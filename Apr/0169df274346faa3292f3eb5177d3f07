South African Football Association (SAFA) boss Danny Jordaan has laid criminal charges against singer and former ANC Member of Parliament Jennifer Ferguson who is accusing him of rape. Gauteng Corporate Communication, Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said that she could not divulge the name of the person who Danny had opened a case against, but confirmed that “he opened a case of defamation of character and the police will investigate,” She said. Peters said that the case was opened at the Sandton police station on Friday. Jordaan allegedly wants Ferguson to refrain from making “defamatory” and “false statements” against him. Meanwhile, it was also reported that Jordaan had also opened a case of defamation against Orlando Pirates boss and chairman of the Premier Soccer League Irvin Khoza. However, the police could not divulge more information regarding the case. The musician and former ANC MP initially made the accusations against Jordan last year. After five months of accusing him of rape, Ferguson laid the charges in March this year. In the wake of the accusations against him, Jordaan had initially kept quiet. However, following public outcry for his comment in the issue he had then issued a statement and denied the claims. Jordan has since maintained his innocence on these allegations. -TNA Reporter
