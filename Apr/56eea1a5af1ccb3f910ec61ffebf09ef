A police official has been arrested for the deadly taxi violent related shooting at  Durban’s Brook street taxi rank. The cop was among the 16 people that were also arrested in New Germany on Saturday and several guns were seized. According to reports, the suspects fired multiple gunshots at the taxi rank on Friday before fleeing the scene. A 56-year-old man died in hospital while three others are recovering in hospital after sustaining serious injuries. Police Minister Bheki Cele praised the police for their swift reaction and also announced that 9 AK47 assault rifles and 7 9mm pistols were seized during the arrest. “I have never seen so many AK47s in recent times. The police have been able to establish that most of those arrested work for a certain security company,” he said. Cele said the police are in the process of identifying the owners of the security company and also to establish what their business was at the taxi rank. He said it was very worrying that one of the arrested people was a police officer who is based in the nearby areas and the police were in the process of finding out his involvement. -TNA Reporter
