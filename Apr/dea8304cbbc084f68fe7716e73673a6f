THE Competition Commission has given the go-ahead for the merger between Pioneer Foods and Heinz Foods SA, with conditions attached. Pioneer Foods is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pioneer Foods Holding which is controlled by the Pioneer Food group and operates in the food, groceries and beverages market. Heinz Foods SA is a food manufacturing and distribution joint venture established in 2003 by Heinz SA and Pioneer Foods. The joint venture was unconditionally approved by the Tribunal in 2003. Heinz Foods SA markets the Heinz range of ketchups, soups and baked beans in the SA domestic market. It also produces and markets Wellington’s range of sauces and condiments, as well as the distribution of John West, Today and Mama’s products. The commission found that the proposed transaction will have a negative impact on employment in that it is likely to result in certain employees being retrenched. In order to minimise the negative impact of the proposed transaction on employment, the commission recommended to the Tribunal that the proposed transaction be approved subject to specific condition. It ruled that the merging parties may not retrench any unskilled employees (and employees with a qualification less than Grade 12) within two years of the merger being implemented. Although certain skilled and semiskilled employees are likely to be retrenched as a result of the proposed transaction, the commission further imposed a condition that this number should not exceed 27 workers, The commission insisted that in the event that the retrenchments take place, the affected employees should enjoy preference in respect of any suitable positions that may become vacant within at least 12 months of the retrenchment date. thelman@thenewage.co.za
