RHODES University has confirmed it will honour internationally recognised South African singer, songwriter, entrepreneur, humanitarian and teacher Yvonne Chaka Chaka, in what the university has termed its “first ever such event” in Johannesburg. The Umqombothi singer, known to music fans as the Princess of Africa, alongside former deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke will be conferred with honorary doctorates at a graduation ceremony from April 5 to April 7, with a celebratory event to be attended by the university’s alumni and key stakeholders next month. “For a university to confer an honorary doctorate in absentia is an unusual occurrence. It is appropriate that we acknowledge and celebrate these individuals in a manner that is befitting of recipients of the highest accolades conferred by the university, hence this extraordinary ceremony,” Rhodes University vice-chancellor Dr Sizwe Mabizela said. Last year the Soweto born veteran performer was honoured with an International Global Good Star and Power Award at the BET Awards in Los Angeles for her humanitarian efforts which spanned more than two decades both locally and internationally. -SIYABONGA SITHOLE|siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
