South African Transport and Allied Workers Union(Satawu) has called on non-striking bus drivers to down their keys in order to make sure that the employers accede to their demands. Satawu made the call after negotiations between the unions and employer representatives which were facilitated by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) deadlocked over the weekend. The unions initially demanded a 12% salary increase while employers could only offer 7%. They rejected a revised offer of  8% for the first year, and 8.5% in the second year and proposed a 9.5% increase in the first year and 9 % in the second year. “The bus strike continues,  we are calling on non-unionised members to down tools in order to put more pressure on the employers to give us what we want. we are intensifying our action,” Satawu spokesperson Zanele Sabela said. South African Civic Organisation(Sanco) has also thrown its weight behind the striking drivers after Numsa announced that it was also supporting the strikers last week. Sanco Spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu said they do recognise that the strike affects many poor working class people who commute daily from home to work. “It is the poor working class commuting daily to and from work that are the hardest hit as they cannot afford any alternative transport system,” said Sanco spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu on Saturday. -TNA Reporter
