The Democratic Alliance (DA) has been rocked by another division within the party over the proposal of the party leaders term extension ahead of the 2018 congress due to be held next weekend. According to reports, a proposal to extend party leader Mmusi Maimane’s term of office from three years to five years is believed to be causing more divisions within the DA. DA members believed to be Maimane’s loyalists have proposed for the Congress that is due to sit next weekend to amend the party’s constitution on the current party leaders term of office that is at three years to be extended to five. However, this has allegedly not received the support of some DA leaders. The Sunday Times is reporting that the chief whip John Steenhuisen is another MP who has also object to proposed changes to the DA constitution as this “would make it difficult to hold Maimane accountable.” This comes after another proposal is believed to be dividing the party.
Meanwhile last week, the party defended its move on tabled motion to amend the party’s constitution to include diversity as a value. This is also expected to be debated in the upcoming DA’s congress. This was reported to have further created race divisions within the party. However, Democratic Alliance MP and Shadow Communications Minister Phumzile Van Damme said that these were mere battle idea within the party. “It is a pity that this battle of ideas in the DA is racialised and black DA supporters painted as supportive of a specific policy viewpoint, and white supporters, another,” she said. -TNA Reporter
