Live AMP co-host, Lerato Kganyago has on Tuesday confirmed her departure from the popular music show. There is an amazing shift happening in my life, My Soul, My Spirit and MY body are aligned… can’t really explain the feeling. I’m HAPPY and CONTENT with the decisions I’m making. Thank you to EVERYONE that has been part of this amazing journey ! A post shared by  Leratokganyago (@leratokganyago) on Apr 17, 2018 at 5:01am PDT  Kganyago who has been a co-host for two years said that that amount of time in the same spot is a little too long for a Soweto girl like her as she is always looking for a new challenge. “I will forever be indebted to SABC 1 and Urban Brew for allowing me the unparalleled opportunity to showcase my talents on the country’s premium music entertainment offering,” said Kganyago. Her last appearance on the show will reportedly be on May 18. -TNA Reporter
