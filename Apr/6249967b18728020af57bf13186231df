A security crackdown at the Goodwood Correctional Facility in the Western Cape is expected to continue following the stabbing of two wardens on Sunday. It is reported that the incident took place at around 8 am on Sunday when the wardens were opening cells to feed offenders. Correctional Services Department spokesperson Simphiwe Xako said that it is believed that the attack was part of prison gang ritual. “An inmate has also been hospitalised after boiling water was thrown over him,” Xako said. Both the wardens sustained head injuries and were rushed to hospital but were later discharged. -TNA Reporter
