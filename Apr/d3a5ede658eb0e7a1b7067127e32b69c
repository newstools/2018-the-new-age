The NPA’s Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) has obtained a restraining order against the assets of several individuals and entities implicated in the controversial Vrede Farm Dairy Project in the Free State. According to the AFU, the order was obtained in connection with an ongoing criminal investigation by the Hawks. Earlier on Monday, the police and South African Revenue Service (Sars) raided the controversial Gupta compound in Saxonwold. It is not clear whether the raid was in connection with the same case, or on another one. Among some of the properties included in the restraining order include residential, business premises and farms, two aircraft, a helicopter, vehicles and bank accounts belonging to Oakbay Investments, Islandsite Investments 180, Confidents Concept, Sahara Computers, Westdawn Investments and Aerohaven Trading. In February, eight suspects who were arrested in connection with the project were released on bail ranging from R10 000 to R200 000. “The order makes provision for the restraint of several assets to the value of R250 202 652.00, pending the finalisation of the criminal trial and upon conviction, the AFU will apply for a confiscation order for the recovery of the said amount and or any related amounts,” the AFU said in a statement. -TNA Reporter
