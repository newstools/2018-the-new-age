Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan on Wednesday said he is seeking legal advice on the ruling made against Eskom board member Mark Lamberti. On Tuesday, the North Gauteng High Court found Lamberti guilty of discrimination and wrongfully impairing the dignity of chartered accountant Adila Chowan by referring to her as an employment equity candidate in front of her colleagues. Lamberti, who is a CEO of Imperial Holdings, apologised to Chowan after the ruling and said he regretted his words, adding that it was not his intention to insult or demean her in any way. He was recently appointed to the Eskom board byPpresident Cyril Ramaphosa, to turn around the ailing power utility. Meanwhile, the Black Business Council (BBC) has called on Eskom to remove Lamberti from its board, as failure to do so would confirm that they are happily harbouring a racist who has no regard for black people and women. “It will also mean that these organisations and companies support racial and gender discrimination. This case confirms that Lamberti should not be holding any leadership position in South Africa,” the BBC said in a statement. -TNA Reporter
