ANC National Chairperson Gwede Mantashe on Saturday cautioned speakers at the funeral of late struggle Icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela against using funerals as a platform to fight political battles. Mantashe said funerals were about celebrating the lives of those who had passed on. “When we were coming to this funeral, we were locked in a room, we were told that one of the worst things we can do as leaders of the ANC is to use platforms of funerals to fight battles. And I think this message must be spread… And appreciate that funerals are about celebrating the lives of people who have departed, it’s about mourning,” Mantashe said. He said those who used Mam’ Winnie’s funeral as a platform to open up old wounds were in the process “going to hurt more people in the day of the departure of Mam’ uNomzamo.” He reiterated that the event was a celebration of a leader. “We are here to celebrate the life of a great leader of the ANC. We are sending off a leader of the people, a friend of the workers.” Mantashe also called for the late struggle icon’s death to bring unity within the ANC. “The spirit of Mama Winnie must unite the ANC. A united ANC is better, strong and cannot be defeated.” Mantashe said that though Madikizela-Mandela was married to an icon, Nelson Mandela, she had lead her own struggle. “One of the important things to remember about Winnie and Mam’ Albertina Sisulu is that they were mothers, they were in the women’s structures but they never walked in the shadows of their husbands, they were leaders in their own right.” Following outcry over Madikizela-Mandela’s house in Brandfort that is due to be transformed into a museum in her memory, Mantashe promised that the ANC would complete the stalling project. “We must also commit that where we have not honoured our commitment, we will now honour, I am thinking now of the house in Brandfort, the ANC must commit in following that programme through.” -TNA Reporter
