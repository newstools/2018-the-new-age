The Black Business Council (BBC) on Wednesday said Eskom must remove Mark Lamberti from its board after he was found guilty of discrimination. “BBC calls on AMH (the parent company of Imperial Holdings Limited) to take harsh action against Imperial CEO Mark Lamberti and Ockert Janse van Rensburg, Group Chief Financial Officer of AMH for conspiring and discriminating against Adila Chowan, a chartered accountant, on the basis of her race and gender. “The BBC also callS on Eskom to remove Lamberti from its board,” the BBC said in a statement. The High Court in Johannesburg found that Lamberti violated the dignity of Chowan, a former Imperial employee, by saying that she was a candidate of female employment equity. In his final judgment on the matter, Judge Piet Meyer said: “There is a great public interest in ensuring that the existence of systemic discrimination and inequalities in respect of race and gender be eradicated. As blatant and patent as discrimination was in the days of apartheid, so subtle and latent does it also manifest itself today.” Following the ruling, Lamberti has since apologised to Chowan saying that his comments did not intend to insult her. However, the council said failure by the organisations that Lamberti is affiliated to, to act against him would be an indication that they harbour racism. “It will also mean that these organisations and companies support racial and gender discrimination.” -TNA Reporter
