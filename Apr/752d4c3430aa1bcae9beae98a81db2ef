The Durban High Court has on Friday postponed former president Jacob Zuma’s corruption case to June 8. The case was postponed to allow Zuma time to launch his review application on May 15. Senior State prosecutor Billy Downer said the reason to seek the adjournment was what he called a “twofold” as Zuma wanted to bring a review application and hoped to finalise the review papers by May 15. On the other hand, President Zuma co-accused Thales South Africa also wanted to make representations to the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NPA) on why they should not be prosecuted. Zuma faces one count of racketeering, two counts of corruption, one count of money laundering and 12 counts of fraud. He is accused of taking bribes from French arms maker Thales over a contract worth R30 billion during his time as a provincial economy minister and then deputy ANC president. Meanwhile, his legal team confirmed that they will challenge the legitimacy of the decision to prosecute him. Former acting National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Mokotedi Mpshe dropped charges against Zuma in 2009, citing political interference at the time. On Thursday Zuma’s supporters held a night vigil ahead of his court appearance. Nkosentsha Shezi of the National Funeral Practitioners Association of South Africa (Nafupa) said that students from the Durban University of Technology and some business organizations will be joining in the march in support of Zuma. “The RET champion which is a combination of business forums have joined together to say that they are standing 100% behind the former President Jacob Zuma. Indeed we are organising a night vigil.” He said that the march would also be joined in by civil society organisations. “But we organizing everybody to come on the 6th at Orta park in Durban, we’re going to have the biggest march ever seen.” -TNA Reporter
