The O.R Tambo international airport has warned travelers of a possible delay due to the nationwide strike by the South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) on Wednesday. “As this is a national strike, there is some potential impact on road transport. This could have an impact on the time it takes to travel to the airport. We would advise passers tom play it safe. To anticipate potential delays and leave early for the airport that they would under normal circumstances,” reads a statement issued by the Airports Company of South Africa (ACSA). thousands of workers affiliated to Saftu are expected to take to the streets to protest against the proposed labour law amendments for a R20 an hour minimum wage and amendments to labour laws which will allegedly deny workers their constitutional right to strike. The airport says that it does not anticipate flight delays at this point but management would continue to monitor as the day progresses. “As a national key point we have contingency plans in place that can be activated immediately should the situation wants such action,” said OR Tambo spokesperson Leigh Gunkel-Keuler. -TNA Reporter
