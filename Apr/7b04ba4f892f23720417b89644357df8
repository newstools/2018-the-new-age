ANC Youth league leadership has described the late Winnie Madikizela Mandela as someone who fought against the oppression of black people in South Africa. The youth league’s leadership visited the late struggle veteran’s house in Soweto where they paid their respects to the late stalwart. Madikizela Mandela died on Monday after being in and out of the hospital from late last year to early this year. ANCYL Deputy Secretary-General Thandie Moroka said Mama Winnie fought against all forms of discrimination including that of young people on the basis of their age, hence their arrival at her house to pay their respects. “Right now we are still being oppressed as young people. We are being discriminated against. “The league will mobilize all its members to mobilize and continue with the fight against oppression and discrimination.” She said the league wants to change South Africa into a country that Madikizela Mandela would have loved to see. Mama Winnie will be buried on Saturday next week in Fourways Johannesburg. -TNA Reporter
