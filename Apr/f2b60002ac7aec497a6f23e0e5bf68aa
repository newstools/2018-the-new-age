The cost includes “over R20 000 on flights and accommodation for former COO, Hlaudi Motsoeneng, and more than R31 000 on the travel costs of former CEO, James Aguma. Some of the other estimated travel costs the SABC covered, include: R183 000 for former SABC Chairman, Professor Mbulaheni Maguvhe,” reads the DA statement. The party had written to the SABC requesting it to provide information related to the accommodation costs it incurred for individuals who were called before the inquiry and also on whether any costs would be recovered from those who went to Cape Town for the duration of the SABC inquiry but did not attend its meetings.
