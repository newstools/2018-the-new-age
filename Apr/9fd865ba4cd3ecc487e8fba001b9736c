A one-year-old toddler was rescued after his father threw her from the roof of a shack during a demolition conducted by the Nelson Mandela Metro Municipality on Thursday. According to police, her 38-year-old father allegedly climbed with her onto the roof where he attempted to throw her off, as police swept in to remove the illegal shack dwellers.

As the man was grabbed by police, he threw his child off the roof,” said the police in a statement. Fortunately, a member of the Metro Police caught the girl and the father was arrested and will be charged with attempted murder. The case will be investigated by the Motherwell Cluster Family Violence, Child Protection, and Sexual Offences (FCS) unit. The Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie applauded the police for rescuing the child. “It is shocking that a father would attempt to sacrifice his own child for the sake of delaying the demolishing of an illegal shack structure. He will be facing the full result of the Law against his actions,” said Rabie. -TNA Reporter
