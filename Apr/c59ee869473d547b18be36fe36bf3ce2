Kwaito musician and convicted rapist Sipho “Brickz” Ndlovu has on Friday been granted R80 000 bail by Magistrate John Baloyi in the Roodepoort Magistrates Court. The kwaito artists bail was granted pending his appeal against his rape conviction which was handed down in the same court last year. As part of his bail conditions, he is now expected to hand in his travel passport and is not permitted to leave Johannesburg. He will also have to report to the Jabulani Police Station twice a week. Last year in October Bricks was sentenced to 15 years in prison for raping his 17-year-old niece in November 2013. While handing down his sentence last year Magistrate Baloyi said the aggravating factors in the case were that Ndlovu’s niece was a virgin and that he infected her with a sexually transmitted disease. The magistrate further said Ndlovu had shown no remorse, despite evidence showing that the victim also suffered emotional and psychological trauma and had attempted suicide. The woman said in a statement that she was not coping well after the rape. -TNA Reporter
