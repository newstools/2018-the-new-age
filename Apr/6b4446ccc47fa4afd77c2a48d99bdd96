Cosatu in the Western Cape has condemned The Golden Arrow Bus Services (GABS) for protesting, stating that these actions have shown disregard for commuters. This comes after bus drivers embarked on a strike on Wednesday and have vowed to continue striking until all the demands they have put forward are met. The Trade Union Provincial Secretary Tony Ehrenreich said that Cosatu supports workers in wage demands and has called on the government to nationalise mass based public transport and pay the workers decent wages. “However, strikes are meant to pressurise bosses to pay decent salaries not to add pressure on commuters with no alternatives. “People buy bus tickets in good faith and for that reason, Gabs is obliged to provide the services to them.” Cosatu has further called on Gabs to arrange with Metro Rail to accept bus tickets on the trains, as Metro Rail usually arranges for its commuters. “It is only because of the disregard Gabs has for workers and commuters that it’s not making a similar arrangement.” -TNA Reporter
