ANC secretary general Ace Magashule will on Monday unveil Mama Winnie Madikizela Mandela Tribute Wall at Luthuli House, Johannesburg. The ANC said this is part of the ongoing ten-day mourning period. “The Tribute Wall will be another interactive platform in honor and celebration of Mama Winnie’s iconic life of Selflessness, Courage and Patriotism. “The platform will allow members of the general public to sign their own desired messages of condolences and support dedicated to the Mother of the Nation,” said ANC in the statement. -TNA Reporter
