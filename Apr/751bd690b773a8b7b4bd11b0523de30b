Convicted racist Vicki Momberg’s application for leave to appeal her conviction on four counts of crimen injuria and sentencing was postponed on Wednesday after it was announced that her lawyer was hospitalised. Momberg’s lawyer Kingdom Onah, who was standing in for Kevin Lawlor, who has reportedly been in hospital since Monday after he fell ill, also requested copies and transcripts of the 10111 calls in which Momberg repeatedly uttered the k-word to operators. The hearing will now take place on Wednesday 11 April. Momberg approached the Randburg Magistrate’s Court seeking to appeal her three-year jail sentence, of which one year was suspended and conviction on four counts of crimen injuria after she was captured on video racially abusing a police officer who was trying to help her after she was the victim of a smash and grab incident. -TNA Reporter
