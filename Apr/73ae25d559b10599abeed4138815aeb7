Executive Mayor of Cape Town, Patricia de Lille says that she is ready to fight for her position after losing a vote of no confidence against her on Wednesday. About 70% of councilors who participated in the Democratic Alliance’s Cape Town caucus meeting voted against De Lille on Wednesday. Out of the 97 councillors who voted in the motion, 41 voted against, while 15 abstained/were absent and there was one spoilt ballot. The party said it has lost confidence in De Lille following a number of allegations levelled against her as well as for breaching the Code of Conduct for Councillors and the party’s Constitution. She is accused of bringing the DA into disrepute and for breaching the conditions of her suspension. Speaking after the caucus meeting, De Lille said that she expected the meeting to come out with the decision that it took. “But this is just the beginning of another round for a fight, and I have said, I am always ready to fight. I will fight for fairness. We will just go on. Tonight [Wednesday]what really happened was that people made a lot of untested allegations against me, not backed up by facts.” she said An independent investigation by Bowman Gilfillan found ‘prima facie’ evidence of gross misconduct, gross dereliction of duty, and conduct that amounted to deceiving Council against de Lille. Following this, De Lille will now make representations to the DA’s Federal Executive and give reasons why she should not be fired “ and I’m ready for that ” she said. The federation will, thereafter, take a decision whether they support her representations or not. She said that at the moment she was waiting for the federation to call her. Next round!
