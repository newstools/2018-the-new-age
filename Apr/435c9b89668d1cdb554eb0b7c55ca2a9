Embattled Mayor of Cape Town, Patricia de Lille says she is waiting for a signal from Mama Winnie Mandela and stands ready to defend herself. This comes as the Democratic Alliance’s Federal Executive on Wednesday is expected to meet in order to discuss an internal motion of no confidence against her after the DA Cape Town caucus requested that the Federal Executive permit it to table an internal motion of no confidence. De Lille on Wednesday morning said that she has not been officially informed about the meeting and had only heard about the meeting through the media. “I will await an official response from the party in order to understand what is going on but I am always ready to defend myself,” she told news channel ANN7. A defiant De Lille said that it was apparent that the party is hell-bent on getting rid of her without a disciplinary hearing, using what is now commonly referred to as the “De Lille clause”. Earlier this month, the DA at its federal congress agreed to amend its constitution to include a recall clause for members of the party appointed or elected to the executive. Party leader Mmusi Maimane had declared that the amendment would not be applied retrospectively, however, De Lille remains convinced that it was put together in order to oust her. “Even though the party leader has denied that the clause has been specially designed to get rid of me it is now being applied in my matter,” she said. The Cape Town mayor said that all she is currently seeking is to have a transparent disciplinary process, open to the public where she will clear her name. “I want the disciplinary proceedings to take place in public because my name has been smeared in public. I have suffered extensive reputational damage because I have not been afforded a chance to state my side of the case,” she said. According to reports, the DA Federal Executive will release the outcomes of Wednesday’s meeting in a statement. -Siphiwe Mchunu
