Executive Mayor of Cape Town Patricia de Lille on Tuesday handed over title deeds to residents of Pelican Park. Title deeds recipients are previously disadvantaged people from the area. The mayor described the experience as an honour. She said that this was an important step for the city of Cape Town, to empower residents as rightful property owners. “Property ownership restores the dignity of our residents who in the past were not allowed to own any property and the emotion this morning shows that. This is testament to the city’s commitment to redress and reconciliation,” the mayor said in a post on Twitter.
