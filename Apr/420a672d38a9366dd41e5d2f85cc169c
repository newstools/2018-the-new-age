Sipho Khumalo, 26, Aubrey Remos Tjie, 35, Thabo Mokgale, 33, Philemon Makwana, 34 and Kgaogelo Moime, 29, were arrested separately between 3 and 4 April after a high-level task team of investigators comprising of the Hawks was established by the provincial police commissioner to track them down. “The above mentioned suspects are facing charges of six counts of murder, attempted murder and malicious damage to property and will be appearing for a formal bail application,” Limpopo police said. The suspects are alleged to have bombed a bus in Burgersfort last week which was transporting mineworkers who were returning from the night shift at the Modikwa Platinum Mine. The bus was carrying about 50 mineworkers, 28 of whom were taken to hospital after suffering burn wounds. Out of the six that passed away, four were men and two were women. Following the incident, Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe visited the families of the deceased and also requested that the police get to the brains behind the bus bombing. Meanwhile, the police said they had received the results of the DNA of the victims that were burnt beyond recognition during the incident and are also due to release the identities of the six on Thursday, after consulting the affected families. -TNA Reporter
