It would seem the recent AKA and Bonang Matheba breakup has made Pearl Thusi some form of an AKA ally. She was among the personalities who came to rally behind rapper, who last week launched his new Cruz Watermelon Vodka limited edition. Other celebrities who graced the intimate launch include close friend and fellow rapper Da Les as well as Isibaya actress Nomzamo Mbatha. For the rapper, who began his year on a low note following his break up with Matheba, this was a welcome move for many of his fans. The man who says he has always had a broader vision to maintain his longevity and brand influence beyond music, described his latest venture as ground-breaking as he would be making money from each bottle sold. This latest deal comes barely two years after he signed off on a multimillion-rand ambassador deal with the vodka brand in 2016. “The new Cruz Watermelon Vodka combines one of my favourite flavours with the best vodka. We’ve created something so desirable that everyone will want to drink it, whether mixing in cocktails or enjoying straight on the rocks, a truly desirable product.” AKA’s exclusive partnership with the vodka brand is the first of it’s kind in Africa, ranking on the same level as international deals for Sean Combs’ partnership with Ciroc and 50 Cents’ with Vitamin Water. AKA also indicated that the game-changing partnership by Cruz Vodka had made it possible to empower African artists while encouraging other brands to invest rightfully within the entertainment industry and talent/artists holistically. The brand’s Africa chief executive officer David de Mardt, who was also part of the launch, said that the ‘All Eyers on Me’ rapper took charge of the process in making sure that his vision was executed the way he wanted it to be. – SIMANGELE LEGODI
