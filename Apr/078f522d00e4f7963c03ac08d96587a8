The Limpopo High Court sitting in Thohoyandou has sentenced Daniel Zambukeri to an effective life imprisonment for killing his brother’s wife. Zambukeri was found guilty for his starring role in the brutal murder of his elder brother’s wife, Hlayisani Preshia Hlongwani (26). This comes after Zambukeri promised to accompany the deceased from Nsavulani village to Hlomela where she was going to fetch her child. Zambukeri organised the vehicle but when they arrived at Hlomela village, the car drove straight into the nearby bushes. The deceased’s legs were then tied to the tree and was left alone. In the evening, the accused returned to that spot attacked the deceased broke her arm and cut off her body parts before killing her. Following intensive investigations, the accused was later arrested with three other suspects who were released on R5000 bail to allow for a separation of the trial. Nkhensani Christinah Mhlongo, 52, Solomon Mngengeni Mahumani, 53, and Amos Mafemani Chuma, 45, are still expected to meet the same fate when they appear in the same court in May. The Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has welcomed this long jail term and also commended the Giyani Detectives on the job well done. “We hope that by removing this criminal from our streets for such a long time, will serve as a deterrent to all the criminals out there and our communities will also stay peacefully. “All the criminals who are still engaged in any form of criminal activities especially crimes against women will be dealt with mercilessly and without compromise,” Ledwaba said. -TNA Reporter
