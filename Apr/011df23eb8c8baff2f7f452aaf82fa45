Air passengers could find themselves landing and departing from Winnie Madikizela-Mandela International Airport if the Department of Transport’s proposal to rename Cape Town International Airport is accepted. Transport Minister Blade Nzimande confirmed that he had brought forward Madikizela-Mandela’s name for the possible renaming of the airport in March, long before Madikizela-Mandela’s passing earlier this month. According to Airports Company South Africa (ACSA), Some of the names that have been brought forward along with Madikizela-Mandela’s are those of Nelson Mandela, Albertina Sisulu, and Robert Sobukwe. There have been increased calls for the airport to be renamed after the late struggle icon who died two weeks ago after kidney complications. On Saturday, during his speech at Madikizela-Mandela’s funeral, EFF leader Julius Malema called on the ANC government to rename the airport after her to show its seriousness about its honour. -TNA Reporter
