FOLLOWING another successful night out for Team South Africa at the Commonwealth Games, Caster Semenya wrapped things up with a gold medal in the 1500m yesterday. Semenya smashed Zola Budd’s 34-year-old record and set a new Games mark, racing past the field to post a winning time of 4.72 seconds. Not to be outdone by the track and field team, SA’s aquatic squad were no slouches either, with men’s 4x100m swimming relay team claiming a bronze medal while, Brad Tandy, also a part of the foursome‚ added an individual silver in the 50m freestyle. Today though, long jumpers Luvo Manyonga and Ruswahl Samaai will come under the spotlight in the final of the long jump after both cleared the 7.90m to earn automatic qualification mark on their first attempt. Manyonga went 7.91 and Samaai 8.06, but steep competition will come from Australian Henry Frayne. Also in the final today is javelin thrower Sunette Viljoen, as well as track medal prospects Clarence Munyai and Anaso Jobodwana. -NEVILLE KHOZA
