The acting GCIS Director-General Phumla Williams said the late stalwart Winnie Madikizela Mandela will be remembered as one of the strongest women in the struggle against apartheid. Williams said Madikizela Mandela played a formative role in the opposition to apartheid and in building a non-racist, non-sexist and democratic South Africa. She added that South Africans will forever be indebted to the role she played in the country’s liberation. “Government expresses its gratitude to all South Africans and the international community for taking leave of Mama Winnie in the dignified and uplifting manner through tributes, messages of condolence and memorial events. “Government thanks the Madikizela and Mandela family for sharing Mama Winnie with the nation and the world during her life and in her death. The family has generously worked with the government to make it possible for all South Africans to share in mourning our stalwart. “The government acknowledges the role played by our security forces who ensured a smooth and incident free funeral service and numerous public servants who worked tirelessly over the week to stage the Special Official State Funeral.” The funeral was attended by more than 40 000 mourners at Orlando Stadium and overflow facilities around the stadium together with the millions of viewers following the proceedings on television. Williams also thanked local and international media for their constructively and patiently working with government over the past few days and for ensuring that this important occasion reached all South Africans and the world. -TNA Reporter
