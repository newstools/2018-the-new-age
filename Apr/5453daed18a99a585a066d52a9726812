Fifty-four people will appear at the Mooi River Magistrates Court later today to face charges of public violence after they were arrested in connection with the torching of trucks in the area last night. Last night 18 trucks were burned and looted on the N3 highway which led to the closure of the highway, which links Johannesburg and Durban in both directions. According to police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele, it is difficult for the police to give a definite answer about the protest. Mbhele said there are a number of rumours going around about why the residents were protesting. “We have been getting different stories about why the people were protesting. Some say the people are saying truck owners were not hiring people from the area, however, this is surprising because the trucks are from Johannesburg and Durban, not Mooi River.” Mbele has not ruled out the possibility of making more arrests as the investigations were ongoing. Clean-up operations are currently underway and the road has now been partially re-opened. KwaZulu-Natal MEC of Transport Mxolisi Kaunda is expected to visit the area later in the day. -Afro Worldview
