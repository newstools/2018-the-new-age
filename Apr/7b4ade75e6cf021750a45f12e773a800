The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has urged workers to participate in the nationwide strike organised by the South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) on Wednesday. Thousands of workers affiliated to Saftu are on the streets all over the country to protest against the proposed R20 an hour and amendments to labour laws which will allegedly deny workers their constitutional right to strike. “Economic Freedom Fighters stand in solidarity with Saftu. The government has already imposed VAT, Sugar Tax, Fuel Levy and all other manners of taxes to resolve an economic crisis that the workers did not create, the very same government proposes that the NMW for all workers should be R20 per hour, even less than the minimum living wage that was the findings of the research from UCT in 2014,” said EFF. Hundreds of workers assembled in Newtown in Johannesburg to march to the Department of Labour.  While other workers in Cape Town march to Parliament. The march is supported by a number of unions including, the South African Liberated Public Sector Workers Union (SALIPSWU), the Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union (DEMAWUSA) and the National Freedom Party (NFP) which also urged members to partake in this activity in a disciplined manner. “The ANC claims to advocate for Radical Economic Transformation and yet their proposed bill will further entrench poverty and cause the present inequalities to remain a permanent feature of our nation,” said EFF. The party says that the action was an attack on the labour force of South Africa’s and a deliberate programme to further oppress ‘our people’.    -TNA Reporter
