South African cellular networks will no longer be deducting airtime from consumers when their data bundle has depleted. This is according to Independent Communications Authority Of South Africa (ICASA). The agency’s councillor Botlenyana Mokhele says it is well known that South African’s are concerned about the money they spend every month on data. “There were concerns about expiring data bundles and high out-of-bundle data rates.” Mokhele said the amended regulations will allow users to transfer data to other users. She further said the agency will regulate data services after following necessary steps, adding that the regulations will be around the Transfer of data. Icasa said the new regulation requires service providers to provide an option to roll over unused data, in order to ensure consumers don’t lose unused data. The newly amended regulations come after ICASA conducted numerous public hearings to draft certain charter regulations on data spending. Early, in the year ICASA compared the cost of data within BRICS nations as per the request of the public. During the African National Congress (ANC) conference in December last year, Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel said the ruling party was looking at getting data costs down in the country. “We are a data-driven society. What oil and steel was to the 20th century, data is now the critical fuel and data costs must come down.” He also announced a market inquiry on how to reduce the cost of data was also on the cards. At the same time, ANC Treasurer-General Zweli Mkhize echoed Patel’s sentiments saying South Africa should not lose out in the digital economy because of the high cost of data. Mkhize said the ANC should champion the #DataMustFall movement. “It’s an important issue because to ensure that current and future generations don’t lose out in the digital economy. There is a fourth revolution coming and it will be based on knowledge and digitisation.” -TNA Reporter
