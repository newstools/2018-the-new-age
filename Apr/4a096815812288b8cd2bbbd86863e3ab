POLICE are still looking for a third suspect in connection with the murder of a Johannesburg metropolitan police department (JMPD) officer in February. The officer was shot in the head when he tried to stop a minibus from being hijacked in Booysens. He died in hospital. Following the incident, Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba announced that the city was offering a R100000 cash reward for information which would lead to the arrest and conviction of the murderers. “Last night our department of public safety had a breakthrough following a tip-off. “Our JMPD officers consulted the investigating officers at the South African police service and planned a joint operation which led to the arrest of two men at Zola Extension 10 in Soweto,” he said Mashaba said the member of the mayoral committee for public safety, Michael Sun, informed him that both men were positively identified and that the one suspect was identified as the gunman who pulled the trigger. “I wish to thank members of the public who provided us with this information and I commend the Johannesburg central SAPS detectives and JMPD for making this breakthrough. I also thank the Lenasia CPF members and MNH Security for assisting with the joint operation” Sun said. Mashaba said all the people who were involved in attacks or killings of police and EMS officers would be hunted down and brought to book. “Our department of public safety with the JMPD chief of police David Tembe will not rest until these criminals are caught and receive the harshest prison sentences,” Mashaba said. The two arrested suspects will appear in court soon. shonisanit@thenewage.co.za -SHONISANI TSHIKALANGE
