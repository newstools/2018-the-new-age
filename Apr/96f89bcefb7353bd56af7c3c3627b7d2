The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has welcomed the steps taken by the Swedish multinational clothing-retailer H&M to address concerns raised as a result of its hoodie advertisement. In January H&M made headlines when it was involved in a so-called ‘racist scandal’ after it posted an ad of a black boy advertising a hoodie written “Coolest Monkey in the Jungle”. Following the advert, South African H&M branches were forced to close when Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) supporters stormed and trashed stores in Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town. SAHRC spokesperson Gushwell Brooks said that a meeting was held between the commission and H&M’s country manager to South Africa, Pär Darj, to present the company’s plans in addressing concerns which were raised by the commission. The steps taken include amongst others the following: 1) The appointment of managers on diversity and inclusiveness both at a global and national level; 2) Commitment to training its managers and staff on the question of transformation and racism; 3) An undertaking by H&M to submit its internal policies dealing with gender and equality to the Commission; and 4) An undertaking by H&M to provide progress reports and hold quarterly feedback meetings with the Commission to discuss the implementation of its gender and equality policies. Brooks indicated that engagements between H&M and SAHRC form part of the SAHRC’s broader efforts to address the tenuous relationship between business and human rights. -TNA Reporter
