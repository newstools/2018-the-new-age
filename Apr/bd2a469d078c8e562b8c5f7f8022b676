Public Protector Adv. Busisiwe Mkhwebane has on Monday rejected claims leveled against her by the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac) that she watered down the Vrede farm report that had been ‘concluded’ by her predecessor Adv Thuli Madonsela. Casac claims that when Mkhwebane took over as the public protector in 2016, she had found a concluded report into the Vrede farm project which according to the council she “makes no reference to the provisional report in her own report,” “First, the claim that she “watered down” the unsigned Vrede Integrated Dairy Project investigation draft provisional report, which she found in the office shortly after assuming duty in October 2016 is without any substance. The Public Protector South Africa, has always been at pains to explain to the public that the so-called provisional reports have no legal status,” reads a statement by the Public Protector. Casac accused Mkhwebane of deliberately changing the recommendations made by Madonsela as an attempt to protect some highly connected political individuals. The Council also claimed that Madonsela’s report contained a number of recommendations and aspects of the remedial actions that she had proposed, included further investigations into the involvement of Ace Magashule and Mosebenzi Zwane, which Mkhwebane did not do. However, in her response, Mkhwebane says that the reason the report did not enjoy any legal status was that “they were essentially drafts or working documents.” Mkhwebane says that she had no legal obligation to implement the ‘unsigned’ provisional report. -Afro Worldview
