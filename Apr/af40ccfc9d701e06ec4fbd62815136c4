AN EMOTIONAL Ndileka Mandela could not hold her tears as she spoke about her late grandmother, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, yesterday. The Nelson Mandela Foundation held the event to pay tribute to the struggle icon at Constitutional Hill, ironically the same prison where Madikizela-Mandela spent more than 400 days in isolation as a political prisoner. “It is really hard to stand here, we are sore, ‘Big Mama’ as we called her took us by surprise. It is significant that this tribute event is here the same place she received news about my dad’s accident. We still need your support, I am standing here because of the support you’ve given us,” Ndileka said. She said her cousins and aunts were gutted because today also marked 100 days to former president Nelson Mandela’s centenary. She broke down and cried until former first lady Graça Machel went on stage, hugged and embraced her. “It feels a bit unfair to have to talk today, it is difficult for Ndileka and I but we are here to represent the family. Winnie was my big sister, I take long to process pain, I prefer to be quiet to feel and understand it. It is too early to process the pain we are going through,” Machel said. She went on to slam society, saying that they tend to only acknowledge people after they die. “Imagine how wonderful it would be if she was here and heard all the tributes. Honour people when they are still alive. My big sister multiplied in thousands and millions. I challenge each one to do good deeds that she used to do, come Monday after she’s been buried, please continue to embrace and support the family,” Machel said. Sello Hatang, the CEO of the Nelson Mandela Foundation said MadikizelaMandela was full of life and humour and that she was close to the foundation. -NTOMBI NKOSI|ntombin@thenewage.co.za
