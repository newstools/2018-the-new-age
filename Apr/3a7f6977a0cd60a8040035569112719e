THE Department of Public Service and Administration has requested more time for consultations involving ongoing public service wage negotiations. “Following a number of developments in the negotiating chamber and the concerns raised by the negotiating parties, the mandate committee has decided to broaden its consultation within the government and thus ask the council to grant it more time to finalise its internal processes before any new round of negotiation can commence,” Higher Education Minister Naledi Pandor said. The mandate committee consists of the ministers of Finance, Defence, Health, Basic Education, Justice and Correctional Services, Police, Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Labour, State Security, Higher Education and Training, Home Affairs, Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation and Social Development. To allow for the thorough process of consultation, the mandate committee asked that council should reconvene on May 3 to take the process forward. Pandor appealed to all public servants to be patient with the process and allow the parties time to package a workable and sustainable deal for all parties concerned. “We understand the urgency of the situation and the need to conclude these talks timeously but we also want to ensure that we package a deal that is workable and sustainable for both the government, labour and the South African public in general.” Pandor reiterated the call for all parties to commit to the process and work towards an acceptable outcome for all. “We would like to assure all stakeholders that we are committed to this process and thus appeal to all players concerned to focus their energies towards a sustainable outcome of the talks,” Pandor said. news@thenewage.co.za -TNA Reporter
