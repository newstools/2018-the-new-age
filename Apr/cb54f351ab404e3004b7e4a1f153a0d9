NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku on Sunday refused to comment on media reports that the prosecuting authority wants its former boss Mxolisi Nxasana to pay back R158. According to a report in the City Press, the NPA wrote a letter to Nxasana, asking him to pay back the amount, adding that failure to do so would result in the NPA instituting legal proceedings against him. It is reported that the money was given to Nxasana as a travel allowance advance before he went to Geneva, Switzerland, in November 2014 but upon his return, Nxasana failed to provide slips for the trip on how he spent the money. Nxasana reportedly said it may have been his then secretary’s fault that the receipts were not handed in. In a letter reportedly seen by the publication, NPA deputy director of management accounting Livhuwani Ramabulana informed Nxasana that he owed the prosecuting body an amount, which it said had now accrued interest of R198.30 and demanded that he settle it within 14 days. “If we do not receive any response within this period, this office may be required to refer the matter for further legal action,” the letter said. Nxasana is currently awaiting a decision by the Constitutional Court on whether he should return to his former position at the NPA. He told the court that he accepted a R17 million golden handshake after he was put under pressure by former President Jacob Zuma and that he was prepared to return the money to the government if the highest court in the land upheld a North Gauteng High Court ruling that he return it. -TNA Reporter
