Deputy President David Mabuza is expected to answer questions in the National Assembly on Wednesday. This will be Mabuza’s second question and answer session since his appointment as the country’s Deputy President by President Cyril Ramaphosa in February. Mabuza is expected to answer questions on state capture and how the government plans to prevent similar capture from happening in the future and how the government is currently dealing with the allegations. The Deputy President can also expect to be asked about the current unrest currently taking place in the North West where unhappy residents are calling for the removal of Premier Supra Mahumapelo. Including allegations that Mahumapelo handed a cattle meant for emerging farmers to former president Jacob Zuma as a gift. Opposition parties have previously complained to Mabuza, who is a leader of government business about the availability of cabinet ministers to face probing questions from Members of Parliament. -TNA Reporter
