The DA on Thursday said it would write to International Relations and Cooperation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, to urge her to find out the reasons that led to the arrest of a South African businessman. The DA said it would also ask the minister to set out the steps available to the government if there was no basis for the charges against the man, or whether any procedural and substantive rights were violated in the process of him being detained. Justin van Pletzen was arrested in Dubai after he allegedly filmed himself running into Ajay Gupta – and sharing the video on numerous social media platforms. DA Shadow Minister for International Relations and Cooperation Stevens Mokgalapa said Sisulu must ensure that the government of Dubai is holding van Pletzen on conditions that are consistent with his human rights. “It is well known that the Gupta family has vested interests in Dubai and that they will do anything to escape accounting for their role in state capture,” Mokgalapa said. He said the DA was happy with van Pletzen for his patriotism and bravery for filming Ajay Gupta in Dubai when South African Authorities had been trying to track him down to serve a summons on him to appear before Parliament’s portfolio committee on public enterprises, which is currently investigating the alleged capture of state-owned enterprises. “No South African should be intimidated by the Guptas, who have consistently evaded accountability despite various invitations to appear before Parliament.” Mokgalapa said he urged the South African government to act to protect van Pletzen and ensure that his rights were not being compromised in an attempt to protect the compromised Guptas. -TNA Reporter
