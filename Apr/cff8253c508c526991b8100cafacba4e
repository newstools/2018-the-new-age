The DA has filed papers seeking for direct access to the Constitutional Court on Wednesday to have the appointment of Arthur Fraser as National Commissioner of Correctional Services by President Cyril Ramaphosa to be set aside with immediate effect. The DA wants the constitutional court to declare that the President’s appointment of Fraser violated his constitutional obligation. “President’s decision to appoint Fraser falls foul of the President’s own constitutional obligations,” DA said in a statement. Fraser is alleged to have operated a secret and parallel intelligence service from his own home while he was still working for the State Security Agency (SSA). He is also alleged of using millions of rands of public funds for his personal gain. “We think that the decision is irrational and I think it’s right that we take it on review. President Cyril Ramaphosa has taken one person who is facing a  legal action in one department and unilaterally shifted them to another department without really applying the proper rationality behind the issue,” Maimane said. Further allegations were levelled against him in the book released by Jacques Pauw earlier this year, ‘The President’s Keepers’, where Fraser was implicated in state capture. The DA says that it had written to the President to give reasons for Fraser’s appointment but he did not give a response. “As such we have little option but to approach the court,” the DA said. -TNA Reporter
