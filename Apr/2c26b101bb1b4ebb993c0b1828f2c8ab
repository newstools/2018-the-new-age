The Democratic Alliance has called on Treasury to intervene and bring to an end the ongoing crisis at the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) following another delay to finalising the new contract to replace Cash Paymaster Services (CPS). This comes after Minister Susan Shabangu suspended the SASSA cash payout tender bid after a competing company, G4S alleged inaccuracies in the process. SASSA is currently going through processes to find a new company to replace CPS. The agency has a deadline of September 30 to have completed the process. ” The Minister continues to rely on self-made emergencies to keep the CPS contract in place, holding social grant beneficiaries to ransom. It is crucial that Treasury intervenes before another deadline is missed and the Constitutional Court is forced to yet again extend the invalid and dubious contract with CPS.” reads the DA’s statement. The DA has also accused former Minister Bathabile Dlamini of leaving a trail of “maladministration and institutional corruption” within the department that requires Treasury’s innervation as “Minister Shabangu is out of her depth in dealing with the destruction and chaos in the Department.” The Minister has stated in court papers that the tender process for the new contractor was technically flawed and had to be restarted. -Afro Worldview
