Public Protector Adv. Busisiwe Mkhwebane has on Tuesday paid tribute to struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela who passed away on Tuesday at the Milpark Hospital, Johannesburg. Mkhwebane said her contribution to the deliverance of the black majority from oppression was well documented. “Madikizela-Mandela epitomized the character that modern South African women ought to emulate as they continue to grapple with violence, discrimination and poverty, among other difficulties,” said Mkhwebane. “Even in the face of untold ruthlessness such as forceful separation from her young children, solitary confinement and banishment from the place she called home, she remained resolute and fought to the bitter end. “Our hearts go out to her family, friends and comrades. We share their pain and loss. May they find comfort in the fond memories they shared with her,” said ” Mkhwebane. -TNA Reporter
