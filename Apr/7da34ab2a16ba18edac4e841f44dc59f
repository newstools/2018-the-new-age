The EFF on Tuesday visited the home Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela to pay respects on behalf of the economic emancipation movement. Following her passing on Monday, EFF leaders together with the party’s Soweto branch and supporters marched outside Madikizela-Mandela’s home. Members sang struggle songs as they arrived outside the struggle stalwart’s home. Party leader Julius Malema, while addressing the crowd, said that Madikizela-Mandela was called “Mother of the Nation”, not because she was elected but the position was bestowed upon her because the people saw a mother in her. He added that the country had failed to defend her while she was alive but called on the nation to defend her now so that South Africans may remember her. “When you character assassinate Mama Winnie Mandela, you character assassinate the black people,” Malema said. Malema: Mama Winnie we will never betray your fighting spirit. — #RegisterToVoteEFF (@EFFSouthAfrica) April 3, 2018 Malema: When you character assassinate Mama Winnie Mandela, you character assassinate the black people. — #RegisterToVoteEFF (@EFFSouthAfrica) April 3, 2018 Malema: Long live the undying Spirit of Mama Winnie Mandela long live. — #RegisterToVoteEFF (@EFFSouthAfrica) April 3, 2018  -TNA Reporter
