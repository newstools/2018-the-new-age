EBRAHIM Rasool has challenged Western Cape Premier Helen Zille and all those critics who have been trying to link him with corruption in the province to present whatever evidence they have to the police. Rasool, the only ANC provincial chairperson to be premier of the Western Cape, threw down the gauntlet to Zille yesterday after his party had announced he would lead its election campaign in the province that he once led. At the press conference he said he was not back in active politics with an eye on the Premiership because he had learned not to look back. Rasool was asked about the Brown Envelope allegations, scandalous allegations that he had paid journalists in Cape Town to wage a media war against his opponents in the ANC. He said: “I’ve responded directly about all of these things. I remember exactly in 2010 when these allegations were made. I left the DA with a challenge. I said I’m going to go away. You’ve got access to all the government papers. Go and find something. If you find something don’t run to the media, go to the police.” Rasool said that the DA has had 10 years to do it. “I know that Premier Zille has had a forensic audit done. “Helen Zille will not hold back if she has found anything. In fact her own office went to a standing committee to say that they have found nothing. “That challenge stands today.” news@thenewage.co.za -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
