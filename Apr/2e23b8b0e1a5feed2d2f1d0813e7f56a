ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule has on Saturday launched the Winnie Madikizela Mandela mural programmes in Soweto. The mural programmes are aimed at honouring the late stalwart Madizela Mandela and celebrate her life. It is said that the mural will be installed throughout the country. The launch comes after a heart-warming initiative by the party’s call for all women in the country to wear black and don a doek in honour of Madikizela Mandela. Madikizela-Mandela died at a Johannesburg hospital on Monday at the age of 81. In showing respect for mother of the nation, cooperative governance and traditional affairs minister Dr Zweli Mkhize has written to provinces and municipalities providing guidelines regarding the farewell arrangements in honour of Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Mkhize is also tasked with ensuring smooth coordination of the funeral arrangements with the provincial and local government. “As an IMC, strong lessons have been learnt from previous State and Official funerals. Amongst these have been the need to balance understandable grief and the need for urgent action, with the requirement of strict adherence to the rules and regulations of financial management policies. It is the worst disservice democratically elected leaders can offer icons such as Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, to shroud her legacy with any act of impropriety either by omission or design’’, said Minister Mkhize. -Sipho Jack
