PICTURES showing how Karabo Mokoena was battered and killed were exhibited in the South Gauteng High Court where a Soweto man is standing trial. Sandile Mantsoe is in the dock for her murder A friend of the dead woman took the stand yesterday and identified the photographs as that of Mokoena. Stephanie Leong who had been friends with Mokoena since December 2013 told the court that the bruises on her body were inflicted by Mantsoe and she told her to leave him after the assault. Leong said she and Mokoena’s family along with police went to look for Mokoena at Mantsoe’s apartment in May last year when they saw the footage. “On the footage I saw Karabo and the accused go into the lift on the day she disappeared. But I never saw Karabo again, I only saw the accused go in and out,” she said. In a video footage which could be crucial in proving that Mantsoe killed Mokoena, Leong said she saw Mantsoe come back with a Pikitup dustbin which he loaded into the car and drove off with two other people inside the car. Mantsoe has pleaded not guilty to all three charges of assault GBH, murder and defeating the ends of justice. Mantsoe’s lawyer said the 22-year-old Mokoena instead committed suicide. MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza was in court and said she was still shocked and shaken by the testimony of Mokoena’s friend. The Gauteng social development men’s forum held a picket outside court in support of the slain Mokoena. The organisation’s spokesperson said it had adopted a stance to fight against all sorts of gender based violence and will demonstrate outside the court premises to display their condemnation of gender based violence. The trial continues today. -DIKELEDI MOLOBELA|dikeledir@thenewage.co.za
