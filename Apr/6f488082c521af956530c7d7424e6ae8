South African Football Association (SAFA) President Danny Jordaan will approach the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) regarding rape allegations levelled against him by a pop singer Jennifer Ferguson. Jordan confirmed that his legal team will approach police and the NPA in a bid to find clarity regarding the rape charge laid by Ferguson. In a statement, Jordaan’s lawyers say they have contacted authorities requesting more information, but failed as they were “unable to determine any information about the whereabouts of the docket. “Despite numerous attempts to contact authorities including two letters directed to the South African police services. We have been unable to determine any information about the whereabouts of the docket.” The statement further said Jordan’s legal team will try to engage the SAPS and the NPA in a bid to deal with the matter as soon as reasonably possible. In March this year, Ferguson laid rape charges against Jordaan. Last year, the public accused Jordaan of sexually assaulting her at a Port Elizabeth hotel after her performance. She also said she had given the soccer boss a chance to talk to her regarding the matter and start their own reconciliation process outside legal actions. Meanwhile, Jordaan’s lawyers have emphasised their clients’ innocence saying Fergusons claims are baseless. “We reiterate that Ms Ferguson’s allegations are absolutely unfounded and untrue and that her true motives are deeply suspect,” Mohlala Attorneys said in a statement. -TNA Reporter
