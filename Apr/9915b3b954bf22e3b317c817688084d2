Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane has noted reports from a local broadcaster and number of international news agencies that use an apartheid-era narrative to cast aspersions on the revolutionary character of Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Mokonyane said that this narrative is a mischievous distortion of the truth and a clear lack of journalistic research. “The attempt to present the legacy of this great liberation struggle steward as a compromised and divisive history is reminiscent of the strategy to undermine what she fought for. “In addition to this distortion of the truth, the narrative is also grossly gendered and seeks to overlook that she was a freedom fighter first, and not just a wife to the late Nelson Mandela,” Mokonyane said. Mokonyane added that Mama Winnie was her own person and boxing her in as former President Mandela ex’s wife is unfortunate and deliberately intended to undermine her as a woman.
