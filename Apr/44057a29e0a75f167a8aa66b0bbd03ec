The South African Municipal Workers’ Union (SAMWU) says it is disappointed with accusations that it has funded its head offices in Johannesburg through a mortgage loan from the under-fire VBS Mutual Bank. Samwu said the City Press went ahead and published a story which is now causing reputational damage to the union despite its General Secretary having told its journalist that the alleged mortgage loan for the union’s offices was not financed by VBS. The City Press reported that the bank had funded the bond at the union’s office to the tune of R11.8 million. Samwu said it instead entered into a credit facility with VBS for the provision of photocopy machines for its head office, provincial and regional offices and is currently being paid through a debit order on a monthly basis. Samwu Spokesperson Papikie Mohale said following the lapse of their agreement with the previous service provider, the union entered into an agreement with the bank to finance the current contract in an agreement which was concluded after a proper due diligence from both parties. Mohale said the union was very concerned because the City Press journalist did not even bother to confirm details surrounding the credit facility which was extended. “The paper further alleges that “a copy of the mortgage deal filed at the Johannesburg deeds office is dated October 4, 2007, and signed by Samwu’s president Pule Molalenyane” this is far from truth as Molalenyane could not have entered into an agreement on behalf of the union in 2007 as he only became President in August 2015,”Mohale said. -Afro Worldview
