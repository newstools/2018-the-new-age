Glebelands hostel murder suspect Khayelihle Mroza Mbuthuma (28) is expected to appear at the Durban Regional Court for sentencing after he was found guilty of killing Sbongile Mtshali. It is alleged that last year in July, Mtshali, 52, was in a room where she was running a tuck-shop when she was approached by two unknown men pretending to be customers. “The suspects opened fire, fatally wounding Mtshali before fleeing the crime scene on foot. Mtshali died on the scene after sustaining gunshot wounds to the head and chest,” said Lt Col Thulani Zwane. KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa praised the team for apprehending the culprits at the hostel. “Community partnership is vital in maintaining peace and stability at the hostel. We are appealing to residents to work together with the police by reporting any criminal activities. We also applaud the efforts the Umlazi Station Commander for her continued attempts to reach out to residents at the Glebelands hostel,” he said. -TNA Reporter
