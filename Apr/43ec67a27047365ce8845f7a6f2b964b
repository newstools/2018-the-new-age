Convicted racist Vicki Mombergs bid to appeal her jail sentence has on Wednesday been denied by the Randburg Magistrate Court. State prosecutor Yusuf Baba opposed her application describing it as vague. Last month Momberg was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment with one year suspended. The former estate agent was found guilty on four counts of crimen injuria in November last year following a video of her that went viral, where she was caught hurling racial slurs towards a black police officer. The officer who received the insult was attempting to assist Momberg after she was a victim of a smash-and-grab incident in Johannesburg in 2016. Momberg hurled the k-word numerous times towards police officers and emergency service operators who had intervened to assist her. At the time of her sentencing, Momberg had expressed her dissatisfaction with the criminal justice system of the country. The Equality Court handed her an R100 000 fine as damages awarded to the victim, Constable Clement Mkhondo. –TNA Reporter
