City of Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille has slammed her party for announcing that it would table a motion of no confidence against her for the second time in as many months. Democratic Alliance (DA) caucus in the legislature on Monday voted in favour of tabling a motion of no confidence against de Lille after the same motion was defeated in February. De Lille is currently facing two disciplinary hearings on allegations of maladministration. The caucus will first have to get permission from the Federal Executive before tabling the motion before council. Last week, the party’s Federal Congress adopted a new recall clause that would make it easy for it to remove elected officials from their positions. De Lille said it is clear that the newly adopted recall clause was aimed at removing her from her position. “The latest move by the DA caucus proves that the Recall Clause is a De Lille Clause and that the DA Constitution was especially amended to have me removed,” she said on Twitter.
