The urgency application for three former South African Revenue Service (Sars) officials Ivan Pillay‚ Johann van Loggerenberg and Andries Janse van Rensburg to appear before the court later this month has reportedly been struck off. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) reportedly agreed to allow the three officials to make their representations on a date that has not yet been revealed. Jacaranda FM reported that the urgent application was struck from the roll in the Pretoria High Court on Tuesday after NPA presented them with an opportunity to make representations. The officials had approached the High Court for an urgent application to halt criminal charges levelled against them. The three officials were issued with summons to appear before the Pretoria Regional Court on April 9 to answer on the charges of corruption and contravention of the Rica Act. Their case is in relation to the case known as the ‘Rogue spy Unit’. The officials were implicated in the KPMG report that has since been discredited on the existence of a unit within Sars which was alleged to be illegally spying on people. Pillay and van Rensburg are alleged of acquiring the services of Helgard Lombard to spy and listen to communications on the then Scorpions officials in 2007. -TNA Reporter
