ANC NEC member Lindiwe Zulu said she believed all the memories they have of Mama Winnie will keep them strong. “It’s a painful moment because we will never be able to smile and laugh with her. But I believe all the words she had to say throughout her life of struggle is what will keep us going.” Zulu further said the month of April will never be forgotten as it was the month South Africa attained freedom and a month where they also lost Madikizela and Zola Skweyiwa. The minister described Madikizela Mandela as a unifier, saying that in the party’s 54th conference she urged party members to unite for the sake of the country. “What we see here hopefully is what we have to see in the building of a new South Africa.” She added that patriarchy played an important role in the lives of South Africans to a point where a woman is not recognised anymore. -TNA Reporter
