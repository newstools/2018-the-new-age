The South African National Civic Organisation (SANCO) on Monday said struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela will be remembered as a liberation struggle icon and true revolutionary. Sanco said Madikizela-Mandela made an invaluable contribution towards the building of a united,non-racial,non-sexist, democratic South Africa as a human rights activist and anti-apartheid leader. “Mama-Winnie was the mother of the nation whose  resilience, courage and indomitable fighting spirit inspired generations of youth and women to strive for freedom ,non-racialism and equality,”said SANCO National Spokesperson,Jabu Mahlangu conveying condolences to the Mandela and Madikizela families,the ANC as well as the country. Mahlangu said mama Winnie inspired and kept the hopes of the oppressed masses alive during a difficult time. “Though she was regarded as controversial by supporters of the apartheid state and those who did not understand her cause for emancipation of women from the triple oppression of class,race and gender, Mama-Winnie has engraved herself and build a monument in the hearts of our people and our communities as a timeless, selfless and fearless leader,” said Mahlangu. Mahlangu added that the country should celebrate her life as she put the interest of the poeple of the country first. “Though we are saddened by her death,her life must be celebrated for her loyalty and compassion to the people and for putting them above her own interests. She was not a Mandela add on,she was a leader in her own right, a champion of the downtrodden and marginalised with whom they identified. Had age and health permitted she would without doubt have made President without needing her husband’s name and or credentials to achieve that,”he added.
