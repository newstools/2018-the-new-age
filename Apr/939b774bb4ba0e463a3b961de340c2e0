MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane hasn’t hid his disappointment with referee Victor Hlungwane following his side’s 3-1 defeat to Maritzburg United in the Nedbank Cup semifinal at Harry Gwala Stadium on Sunday. Mosimane claims Hlungwane unduly influenced the outcome of the clash when he gave Downs player Gaston Sirino a second yellow card but failed to do the same for Maritzburg player Deolin Mekoa. Mekoa was on a yellow card when he kicked Anele Ngcongca – with Hlungwane only giving him a warning. Mosimane believes he should have walked. With Sundowns reduced to 10 men, Maritzburg were able to use their one man advantage as they went on to reach their first cup final. “If you leave Deolin without a yellow card, then why give it to Sirino? If it is a red card and you see it, give him a card immediately, you don’t have to think about it. “And that’s where the game went, what else can we do, it is 10 against 11, we have to try and push on. “Victor is a professional, he knows, he made a biggest blunder, he should have booked Deolin on that.” Mosimane said the club will now focus on the PSL Premiership and the CAF Champions League. Sundowns only need four points in the remaining three matches to win a record eight league titles and will be looking for that win against Maritzburg tomorrow. “We wanted to go to the final but it didn’t happen and we must accept it. “Congratulations to Maritzburg United, they play differently and are awkward to play against. “But we had the whole strategy, it was not a problem in the first half, we controlled the ball but then the red card happened. “I care about losing Anele, I care about losing Sirino, that’s the whole thing I want to say.” -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
