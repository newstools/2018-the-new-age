ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule has expressed his gratitude on behalf of the party for the continuing outpouring of emotion and honouring of Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela displayed by the country since her passing last week. “We appreciate what the people of South Africa are doing all over the country from all walks of life. We highly appreciate how young and old, rich and poor, white and black have paid tribute,” he said on Monday. Magashule was speaking during the unveiling of a tribute wall dedicated to the late stalwart outside the ANC’s headquarters at Luthuli House. Members of the public have been encouraged to write messages of support and condolence on the wall itself.
