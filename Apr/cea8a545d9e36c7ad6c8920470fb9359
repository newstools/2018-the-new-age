Parliamentarians have questioned Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s integrity after she changed tune and admitted to meeting former President Jacob Zuma prior to the release of her Bancorp report. Mkhwebane appeared in Parliament on Tuesday to answer questions from the Portfolio Committee on Justice members. The Public Protector was asked why she told the committee that she has never met Zuma prior to the release, while in her court papers she said she did meet Zuma. “I met with the Presidency’s legal advisor, not the President, to discuss this matter…other meetings, were related to the public protector, and the Executive Members’ Ethics Act,” Mkhwebane said. In the report, Mkhwebane orders Absa Bank to pay R1 billion to the Reserve Bank for the money that was loaned to its predecessor Bancorp in the apartheid era. In February, the North Gauteng High Court dismissed her leave to appeal its ruling that she should personally pay 85% of Absa and the Reserve Bank’s legal costs after the court set aside her report. Parliamentarians were also concerned about the involvement of the State Security Agency (SSA) in her office after she revealed that her security manager was currently being trained by the SSA in the classification of information and that the acting chief financial officer Nonhlanhla Dick was seconded from the SSA. The Democratic Alliance (DA) during Mkhwebane’s interview for the position alleged that Mkhwebane was an SSA spy. “I’m still repeating, chairperson, that I’m not working for SSA. SSA is there as an institution and a constitutional department which is provided for. Why not use them, if they’ve got the resources to deliver the services?” Mhkwebane said. -TNA Reporter
