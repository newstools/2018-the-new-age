The DA has accused Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille as determined to misrepresent and spread alternative facts relating to her disciplinary hearing. Following De Lille’s statement that explains her side of the story relating to the disciplinary hearing, the party said she is trying to garner public sympathy. DA Federal Council Chairperson James Selfe MP said De Lille’s statement that nothing much has happened in the 30 days after the referral of substantive issues pertaining to her, conduct to the Federal Legal Commission (FLC) is simply untrue. “The matter was referred to the FLC on 16 January, in the first 30 days there was a lot of back and forth between the commission and De Lille’s lawyers and the matter has been treated with the urgency it deserves.” He added that delays have been mostly from late response time or no response at all from De Lille or her legal team. Regarding the application for public access and as was discussed with De Lille, He said that the panel shall decide as a collective and inform her of their decision. “Concerning the findings of the proceedings, it is not proper to discuss or criticise them in the press. De Lille is aware of the steps to take if she does not agree with the findings of the panel, she knows where to find the high court. “Although we are keen to finalise the matter, it must be treated with the seriousness it deserves and as such, it may take time. We hope that De Lille will not frustrate the process any further as she has on numerous occasions stated her desire to have her chance to answer the substantive allegations that stand against her.” -TNA Reporter
