SEVEN suspects, including two women arrested in connection with armed robbery, will reappear in the Welkom Magistrate’s Court tomorrow. The suspects, Klaas Telekoane, 28, Lebogang Modise, 33, Abram Monyane, 21, Tlalane Monyane, 25, Dibuseng Moseme, 24, Joeph Thibedi, 26 and Moeketsi Tlhomokonae, 25, appeared briefly in the Welkom Magistrate’s Court last week Tuesday. The case was then postponed for a formal bail application tomorrow. Police spokesperson Capt Stephen Thakeng said all the suspects were arrested last week on Saturday an hour after committing the crime. He said they attacked a couple and the woman’s cousin while they were relaxing at their home in Bedelia. “The incident happened about 12.30pm and the complainant said she was with her fiancé and her cousin, sitting outside having a braai at Juliet Street in Bedelia. “Her fiancé heard the dogs barking and suddenly saw four men who attacked him and pushed him to the ground and started kicking him,” Thakeng said. He said another two arrived and insulted them while attacking her cousin who was asking them what they were looking for. “Another suspect emerged and came straight to the complainant and took her weave from her head, a black Nokia cellphone and a black and grey Azumi cellphone from her fiancé’s pocket. “The woman managed to flee from the suspects and ran into the street and screamed for help,” Thakeng said. He said the suspects, one of whom was holding a gun, got into their car and drove off. “A case of armed robbery was opened and the suspects were arrested within an hour of the incident” he said. beckers@thenewage.co.za -BECKER SEMELA
