Democratic Alliance (DA) Shadow MEC of Health Jack Bloom said the Department of Infrastructure Development (DID) paid more money than it should have for the hiring of the conference facility for the Esidimeni Arbitration hearings. Bloom said the company that charged the Gauteng Provincial Government R8.4 million for use of the Emoyeni Conference Centre paid only R805 000 in 2017 to rent the facility in Parktown Johannesburg which is owned by the provincial government. According to Bloom, this revelation was made by the MEC of Infrastructure Development Jacob Mamabolo in a written reply he posed to him in the legislature. Bloom said in his reply, Mamabolo said a company called Keliana Consulting currently manages Emoyeni on behalf of the Department. He said Mamabolo further said the contract was awarded in 2005 to Keliana, but the tenant was not able to occupy the building due to renovations from 2006 to 2008, so the contract was adjusted for commencement from 2009 to 2013. “I am concerned that Keliana grossly overcharged for the Esidimeni hearings, and is paying too little money for a valuable government property,” he said. Bloom said the provincial government was billed R186 000 a day for the hearing that took place in 45 days. He said he was told by Mamabolo that the department was in the process of reviewing the total property portfolio in order to identify properties where income can be increased and Emoyeni was included in that exercise. “I am aware that the ANC often has meetings at Emoyeni, and Keliana refused to provide me with information some years ago about all the events that they host thereafter I submitted an application using the Promotion of Access to Information Act.” Attempts to get a comment from the Department of Infrastructure Development was unsuccessful. -TNA Reporter
