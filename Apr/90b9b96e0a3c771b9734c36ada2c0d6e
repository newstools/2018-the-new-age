The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) General Secretary Irvin Jim says the union rejects R20 per hour because it legalizes slave wages. Jim said it is highly unlikely that workers will earn R3500, adding that the wage is been set in such a way that bosses control the hours and limit the hours worked. “Workers in Marikana died for a minimum wage of R12 000 the ANC government must not spit on their graves with this R20. Instead of creating jobs the state is, in fact, destroying them.” Numsa General Secretary furthers said the country’s whole economy has been mismanaged by the ANC government for the last 20 years. He said workers were also under siege. “We understand government’s agenda for what it is, an attack on the working class and in particularly organised labour.” The union also said they reject the signing of IPP contracts into the national grid. Jim called for the removal of all boards of State Owned Entities’ (SOE’s) so that they are replaced by representatives from all social partners such as labour business, civil society and government. The union further said they may have lost the court bid on urgency but not the merit of it. Meanwhile, South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) will on Wednesday embark on a general strike against the proposed minimum wage of R20 an hour. Saftu says imposing a salary cap will be a better way to close the wage gap. -TNA Reporter
