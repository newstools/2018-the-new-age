Manchester United handed the Premier League title to Manchester City on Sunday after suffering a surprise 1-0 defeat at home by bottom club West Bromwich Albion. A 73rd minute header from Jay Rodriguez gave Albion, who appear doomed to relegation, their first away win in 16 outings. United midfielder Nemanja Matic had headed a corner across his own goal area and Rodriguez reacted quickly to nod home the winner. Jose Mourinhoâ€™s side had dominated possession but created few clear chances and their loss leaves City 16 points clear with just five games remaining. -Reuters
