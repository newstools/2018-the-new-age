Maritzburg United pulled off one of the biggest shocks in the Nedbank Cup semi-final when they defeated Mamelodi Sundowns 3-1 on Sunday at the Harry Gwala stadium. The Brazilians didn’t take long to break the deadlock when Gaston Sirino secured his first goal for the club after his low shot was fumbled by United goalkeeper before rolling across the line. Maritzburg grabbed an equaliser in the 44th minute through Lebohang Maboe. The Tshwane based outfit were reduced to ten men when Sirino was shown a second yellow card. Maritzburg took advantage of the situation and put pressure on Sundowns. Maritzburg finally grabbed the lead in the 85th minute when substitute Mxolisi Kunene scored a brilliant goal inside the box. Things turned from bad to worse for Sundowns when they conceded a third goal  in the 91st minute when Fortune Makaringe beat Onyango with an easy finish. Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane was not entirely impressed with most of the referee’s decisions. “Mekoa is on a yellow card and he kicks Anele off the pitch, we lose Anele.He kicks him off the ball. Mekoa receives a talk. Gaston Sirino is on a yellow card and of course I am not saying he must not get a second bookable yellow but showed a yellow card.He didn’t manage the game very well,” said Mosimane. The two clubs will meet again in the league on Wednesday at the same venue. Sundowns will be desperate to get a win in order to keep a gap at the top of the table between them and second place Orlando Pirates. Sundowns are leading the table with 55 points while Pirates is on 49 points. -TNA Reporter
