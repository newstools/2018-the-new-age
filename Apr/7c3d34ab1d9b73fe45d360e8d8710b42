Afrikaans lobby group AfriForum has slated government for its decision to stop testing for Listeria at the country’s various ports of entry. The Afrikaans group said it has recently seen a letter in which Head of Environmental Health and Port Health Services, Aneliswa Cele instructs the abandonment of tests after Health Minister Dr. Aaron Motswaledi announced that inland processing plants have already been identified as the source of the outbreak, which has so far claimed almost 200 lives. The government identified Enterprise Food’s manufacturing plant in Polokwane as a source of a killer strain of the virus and ordered the company to stop distribution of ready to eat cold meat products as a precaution. A different strain of Listeria was also found at the Rainbow Food Manufacture plant in Germiston. AfriForum’s Strategic Advisor for Community Affairs Dr. Eugene Brink said there are still unanswered questions regarding the recent epidemic which is the biggest outbreak of the virus ever recorded. “Polony consists of various ingredients, of which many enter the country via ships. “Government’s decision is a premature step and all foreign food products entering the country still need to be tested, while further inland tests also need to be done,” Brink said. Brink said a lot of research still needs to be done as it was not clear how the contamination at the Enterprise plant in Polokwane originated. “Points of sale also continuously need to be better monitored and researched, while polluted water may also be an extremely likely source of contamination. “The Minister of Health himself admits that his Department has a shortage of approximately 3 000 health inspectors, which means that there are many points where contamination can take place.” He said the lobby group was already testing the quality of drinking water and effluent and will in future also test for the presence of the virus in the water to check whether it also contains the virus. -TNA Reporter
