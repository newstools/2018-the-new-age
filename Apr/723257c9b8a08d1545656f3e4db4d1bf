In an attempt to improve passenger and driver safety, in partnership with Namola, Taxify has launched an in-app safety button that connects at-risk drivers to emergency services. This follows the attack on Taxify and Uber drivers in recent months, which was highlighted by the brutal murder of 21-year-old Siyabonga Langelihle Ngcobo last month. The body of the cab driver was discovered in the boot of a burnt car in Pretoria. The safety button will now allow Taxify drivers to access rapid deployment of the correct emergency response in an event where they find themselves in danger. Taxify’s country manager Gareth Taylor said management had already had safety checks on their workers. “Before any driver comes to the platform, there is a criminal background check that is provided on our drivers to ensure that they don’t have a criminal record, in addition to the training that they go through as well,” Taylor said. “Rider and driver safety is our first and foremost priority.” The partnership with Namola is expected to address the concerns of security and driver safety that has befallen the service. -TNA Reporter
