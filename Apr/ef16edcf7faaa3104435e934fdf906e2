Gauteng Police have launched a manhunt for two suspects who shot and wounded two police officers on Thursday morning at the Tembisa informal settlement. It is alleged that the officers were on a routine patrol when they spotted a suspicious vehicle and followed it until it stopped outside a resident. ” Two men who got out of the vehicle started shooting at the police and members returned fire. Police officers were wounded and the suspects managed to flee and they are still at large,” said Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele. ” Their vehicle has been impounded for further investigation,” he added. Meanwhile, a police officer has also been killed in Khayelitsha. It is believed that two officers were ambushed by six suspects on Monday night.
