The African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) has welcomed the appointment of three women as Chairperson of the Council, Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor respectively at Nelson Mandela University (NMU). The ANCWL said the women earned their stripes and also contributed enormously in developing South Africa. Former Switzerland Ambassador Nozipho January-Bardill is appointed Chairperson of Council, Dr Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi Chancellor of the university while Professor Muthwa is appointed as Vice-Chancellor of the university. The league said it expects that the newly appointed leadership of NMU prioritise the safety and security of female students at the university, adding that gender-based acts of violence have been a problem within the education sector in the country and there are some reported cases at NMU. “The ANCWL leadership collective, members and supporters of the organization will continue working with the leadership of various institutions to fight all forms of gender-based violence and oppression. “Society, in general, must also actively play part in inculcating the culture of respect to gender diversity in all sectors of the society including higher education sector.” “Appointment of women into leadership roles is not an act of charity. Women are capable and have the capacity to lead in any sector at any level. The ANCWL congratulates NMU on its progressive decision of having women at the top leadership of the institution and calls for other institutions to emulate the decision of NMU,” the ANCWL said. -TNA Reporter
