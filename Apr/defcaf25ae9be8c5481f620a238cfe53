The Standing Committee on Finance has rejected the DA’s proposal for a special hearing on the controversy surrounding the Public Investment Corporation, Sagarmatha Technologies Limited and Ayo Technology Solutions in Parliament. The proposal was rejected following EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu argued that the Public Investment Corporation has not invested in Sagarmatha Technologies Limited. The party’s shadow Minister of finance David Maynier who wrote to the Chairperson of the committee last week requesting the special hearing said the suggestion that questions on the controversy could be raised in a general meeting in the future is ridiculous. “The fact is that the Standing Committee is turning a blind eye on these controversies, which is neglect of duty given the massive exposure of the Government Employees Pension Fund to Independent Media that was to be part of the Sagarmatha Technologies Limited.” He said that the Chief Executive Officer of the Public Investment Corporation Dr Dan Matjila has promised that when it came to the investment in Independent Media work an ‘exit strategy’ was underway. “The suspicion was that the ‘exit strategy’ will probably never be confirmed, given the blind eye being turned by the Standing Committee on Finance.” -TNA Reporter
