TWO police officers were shot and wounded yesterday when they raided shacks in Diepsloot in connection with suspects involved in robberies. Police arrested four people aged between 30 and 38, who may be linked to several armed robberies in the northern suburbs. Col Lungelo Dlamini said: “Two firearms, a shotgun, a pistol and a stolen vehicle were seized during the arrests. The suspects will be charged with attempted murder, possession of unlicensed firearms and possession of a stolen vehicle, while police are still profiling them as they may be linked to several serious and violent crimes.” The raid was jointly conducted by the SAPS members and the Johannesburg metro police officers following information on suspects involved in serious and violent crimes, including mall robberies. Dlamini said on arrival at one of the shacks, shots were fired at police from inside. “This is when two police officers and a woman who was inside the shack were shot and wounded by the suspects. A woman and one police officer were treated by paramedics at the scene as they had sustained slight injuries. Another police officer who was shot in the left upper body was taken to Milpark Hospital in a stable condition,” he said. The suspect was later arrested and a shotgun without a serial number was seized. Further investigations are continuing. dikeledir@thenewage.co.za -DIKELEDI MOLOBELA
