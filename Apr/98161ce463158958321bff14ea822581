Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Lindiwe Sisulu has on Monday welcomed Australian leaders’ retraction of comments made by their Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton on the South African land redistribution process. Dutton said that Australia are exploring how to bring white South African farmers to Australia on humanitarian grounds due to the land redistribution process and the violence in the farms, which he said was racially charged. Minister Sisulu said they welcome the assurance by the Australian government’s assurance, as report in the media, that the comments made by their Home Affairs minister are not in line with Australian immigration policy. “We also welcome Australia’s condemnation of the unfortunate comments by South African and other international organisations and leaders,” said Sisulu. “We must emphasise, as we have stated before, that no one is being persecuted in South Africa, including white farmers. We call upon all non-governmental organisations to desist from spreading untruths and misleading information,” she added. Sisulu said South Africa is a law-abiding country and, through a Constitutional process, it will arrive at solutions on land redistribution that will take the country forward without violating anyone’s rights. -TNA Reporter
