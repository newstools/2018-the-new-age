They were summoned to appear on charges relating to the alleged bugging of the NPA offices and running an illegal intelligence operation within Sars. The allegations on the bugging of the NPA offices were raised in the largely discredited KPMG report which investigated an intelligence operative structure within Sars, which came to be known by as the “Rogue Unit”. KPMG has since paid back R23 million to Sars. Suspended Sars Commissioner Tom Moyane, who laid the initial complaint against the three, was put on suspension by President Cyril Ramaphosa. -TNA Reporter
