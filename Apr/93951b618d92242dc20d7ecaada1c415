The leader and founder of the African Democratic Change (ADeC) Dr Makhosi Khoza has on Saturday announced her retirement from politics less than a year after forming her own party. The former African National Congress (ANC) member of parliament resigned from the ANC last year and formed ADeC promising to bring change to the politics of the county. “I wish to advise ADeC members and its entire leadership that I have taken a well-thought through decision to step down from politics with immediate effect in pursuit and in fulfilment of my deepest passion, conviction and mission in local governance and administration, education and elevation of African languages as those of prestige and prosperity,” said Khoza in a statement. Khoza says that when she took the decision to retire from politics last year, she wanted to ‘devote’ herself to activities of civil society not completely in politics.  “I still maintained that mine was not to occupy a political position. However, given the fact that these mentioned organisations had started off as civil society movements but later decided to fight local government elections in 2015 arising out of the frustration of citizens, it became necessary that I assist in uniting them behind a common brand, vision and mission,” she said. Last month the party was reported to have internal divisions with other members calling for the resignation of Khoza. However, Khoza came out in defence saying that those who were calling for her head were disgruntled people who were denied party membership. Khosa says that she resigns from politics to pursue ‘opportunities’ that have recently risen. “A very promising potential opportunity has arisen for me to really add maximum value to the entire local governance and administration fields in South Africa and possibly the entire African continent,” she said. -TNA Reporter
