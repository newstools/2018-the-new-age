New Zealand won the toss and elected to bowl in the crucial Twenty20 match against England in Hamilton on Sunday. A New Zealand win would automatically put them into the final of the tri-nation series against Australia on Wednesday. England need not only to win but — having already lost to New Zealand when they met for the first time last week — they must finish with a superior overall run rate to the Kiwis. “It looks like a good surface and perhaps there’ll be a bit of dew later so we need to make the most of it first up,” said New Zealand captain Kane Williamson. Having lost all three games in the series so far, England have been boosted by the return of captain Eoin Morgan who has recovered from a groin strain. New Zealand have been bolstered by the return of Mitchell Santner, who was injured and out of Friday’s run fest against Australia in Auckland. His replacement Ben Wheeler went for 64 runs off 3.1 overs. In addition to Morgan, Liam Dawson and Tom Curran also come into an England side looking to stave off a fifth consecutive defeat. New Zealand have won six of the seven T20s they have played in Hamilton, including a 55-run win over England in 2013.
