The North Gauteng High Court on Friday set aside the Public Protector’s Bankorp-CIEX report in which she ordered that Absa Bank pay back over R1 billion. The Reserve Bank, Treasury and Absa approached the High Court to have the report set aside. The parties argued that the report was flawed and that it rested on material errors of fact. They further claimed that it was motivated by the Public Protector’s personal bias against the central bank. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane released the report in June last year where her remedial action called for Absa to pay back R1.125 billion for a bailout that was received by the then Bankorp from the Reserve Bank during the apartheid era. The court review of the CIEX report began last year in December before a full bench of judges. In December last year, on the first day of the court hearing, council lambasted Mkhwebane’s report. The Reserve Bank was then joined in its action by Treasury and Absa. This was on allegations that the report partly stemmed from her interactions with Black First Land First (BLF) and the and the president. However, Mkhwebane dismissed these and other claims that former President Jacob Zuma had a role in the final CIEX report. Mkhwebane in her remedial action had recommended constitutional changes that would alter the objectives of the Reserve Bank to focus on economic growth rather than currency and price stability. However she clarified that her remedial action was merely a recommendation. -TNA Reporter
