PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has been challenged on whether he has sworn to uphold the SA Constitution “or another one”. Cope leader Mosiua Lekota condemned the appropriation of land without compensation concept in his challenge to Ramaphosa during the debate on the state of the nation address in Parliament yesterday. And ACDP leader, Kenneth Meshoe, pressed Ramaphosa to fire Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba so that a new incumbent could deliver the Budget tomorrow. Lekota’s intervention in the debate saw the EFF, which favours this policy, hurl insults at him. ANC MPs also vented their displeasure. In an aside, ANC MP Mondli Gungubele advised Lekota to read the Constitution to see that expropriation without compensation was allowed “under certain circumstances”. Deputy Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform Mcebisi Skwatsha said that the government believed in the rule of law, but it added there would be “redress”. Lekota said that last Thursday he had joined the then president-elect when he took the oath of office. “The following day … you announced you would expropriate land without compensation,” Lekota said. This, he said, was in contravention of the Constitution, Section 25 of which, said “no one can be deprived of their property. It also says where expropriation happens it must be with compensation.” “The question that must arise is whether you took your oath to this Constitution or to another constitution? “Are you going to amend the Bill of Rights, comrade president so that South Africa must know that this Constitution is no longer relevant under your leadership?” news@thenewage.co.za
