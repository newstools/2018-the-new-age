President Jacob Zuma says he finds it strange that the organisation he grew up is now forcing him to resign. “I feel like I am being victimised by the same organisation I served all my life in.” The president said this while addressing the media in Pretoria on Wednesday. The president said he never refused to step down as head of state, but disagreed with the party’s national officials because they did not give him motivation why they want him to resign. He said he will not resign, despite the immense pressure by his own organisation. “My resignation is being forced on me, we are being plunged into a crisis,” Zuma said. He said during the During negotiations both ANC president and Secretary General agreed that the hand over will be in three months time, to ensure the smooth transition. The president then said they all agreed to postpone the NEC because they had already discussed on how the transition will be handled. This comes after the ANC earlier announced its MPs will vote with opposition parties in a motion of no confidence against him at Parliament on Thursday. Meanwhile, ANC Treasurer General told members of the media that the party was not willing to wait any longer on the issues of the President. “For us as the leadership of the ANC, we cannot wait longer than today. We can’t continue waiting. The decision was taken and it must be implemented,” Mashatile said. -Sipho Jack
