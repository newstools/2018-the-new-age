From this year, first-year students from households with gross combined annual income of up to R350,000 will have access to free higher education and training, President Cyril Ramaphosa said. Following former President Jacob Zuma’s announcement that government will be phasing in subsidised free higher education and training for the poor and working class, Ramaphosa said the Higher Education Minister will lead the implementation. “Minister of Finance will clarify all the aspects of financing the scheme during his budget speech next week.” Ramaphosa also said that in addition to promoting social justice, an investment of this scale in higher education is expected to contribute to greater economic growth, to reduce poverty and inequality, enhance earnings and increase the competitiveness of our economy. He added that government will continue to expand access to quality basic education and improve the outcomes of public schools in the country. “The Accelerated Schools Infrastructure Delivery Initiative programme continues to deliver modern facilities to schools in rural and underprivileged urban areas across the country.” -TNA Reporter
