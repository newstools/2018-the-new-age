ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa has told South Africans that the national minimum wage (NMW) will improve the lives of low paid workers. Ramaphosa was speaking at the launch of the party’s centennial celebrations in honour of late former President Nelson Mandela in Cape Town at the Grand Parade. “The minimum wage will improve the lives of 6.6 million low paid workers in our country and make an important contribution to our ongoing efforts to tackle severe inequality in our country,” Ramaphosa said. “Nelson Mandela would have been very pleased to hear that, finally the objective and the aspiration that was set out in the Freedom Charter has now been achieved because the objective of national minimum wage was first articulated in 1955 when the Freedom Charter was drafted.” Ramaphosa said the ANC would continue to fight corruption in honour of Nelson Mandela. “In defence of Madiba’s legacy we will continue to wage a relentless war against corruption and mismanagement of the resources of our country.” “Nelson Mandela was totally committed against corruption, against theft, against the robbery of assets of our people. We will continue with his legacy of fighting corruption and making sure that those who are corrupt and steal from the poor are brought to justice.” -TNA Reporter
