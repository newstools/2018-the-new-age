The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has called on all eligible voters to visit voting stations on the weekend of the 10 March to update the voters’ roll in preparation for the 2019 elections. All voting stations around the country will be opened to assist new voters to register, allow already registered voters who have relocated to re-register and allow registered voters whose addresses are not on the roll to provide the information. The elections are expected to take place between May and August 2019. Commission spokesperson Kate Bapela said the registration weekend was a milestone towards the culmination of a two-year project to obtain addresses for all registered voters. “It is an opportunity to ensure that voters are registered in the correct voting district segments after the Constitutional Court gave the Electoral Commission until June 2018 to update the voters’ roll with all available addresses,” Bapela said. The commission still needs to update addresses for 2.8million registered voters. Voters visiting stations should take a copy of their bar-coded ID book, smart ID cards or temporary ID certificate. “They will be assisted to complete a registration form providing their home address, which will allow the Electoral Commission to place them in the correct voting district.” -TNA Reporter
