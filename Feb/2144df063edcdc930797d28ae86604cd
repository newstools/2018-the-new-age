Legendary deaf athlete and Olympic medalist Terence Parkin has successfully completed the unbelievably challenging 902km of cycling, swimming, running and canoeing. Parkin completed this incredible test of strength and stamina between Johannesburg and Durban all in support of fundraising for the Deaf Children to Learn how to swim and for the Water Safety Programme. The 37-year-old said his aim was to raise R100 000 for the foundation. “I want to help children in SA to reach their full potential. Swimming has been an incredibly positive influence in my life, physically, emotionally and personally and I want children with hearing difficulties and other challenges to share in my experience,” he said. Parkin made this a challenge to remember by making it as punishing for himself as
possible. Cycling for 5 days across 723 km on both a mountain and road bike on steep
the terrain through the Sani Pass, he then swam a further 13km at the Midmar Mile as part of the Eight Mile Club (where he won both of his events and broke further records) followed
by the completion of a 33km run to the start of the Dusi Canoe Marathon. Parkin pushed himself extremely hard across challenging terrain which included both tar and sand roads and incredibly steep inclines. When the last 15km proved extremely tough he was encouraged by his support team. “My support team were amazing, they left the vehicle to run alongside me and a few of the local children even joined in. It’s an honor to perform a challenge such as this in our country with its beautiful landscapes,” he said. This past Saturday witnessed the final end of his challenge with a 124km, 3-day Dusi
Canoe Marathon with veteran canoeist, Mark Mulder, whom he met for the first time a few
days ago. -TNA Reporter
