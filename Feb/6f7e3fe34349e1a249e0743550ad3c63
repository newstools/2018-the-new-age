The Newly elected President Cyril Ramaphosa says the government will create a Job Summit in a bid to create jobs in the country. Ramaphosa said the government will interact with every stakeholder to make sure they address the unemployment challenge. “The summit will look at what we need to do to ensure our economy grows and becomes more productive, that companies invest on a far greater scale, that workers are better equipped, and that our economic infrastructure is expanded. “We will expect this summit to come up with practical solutions and initiatives that will be implemented immediately.” He said that government will work on encouraging new investment in the country’s economy. “The government will organise an Investment Conference in the next few months to mobilise international and domestic investors to invest in the country.” The president said he will communicate the decline of the country’s manufacturing capacity, which has affected employment and exports in the country. “We will seek to re-industrialise on a scale and at a pace that draws millions of job seekers into the economy. “To this end, we will organise an Investment Conference in the next three months, targeting both domestic and international investors, to market the compelling investment opportunities to be found in our country,” Ramaphosa said. -TNA Reporter
