The ANC in the greater Johannesburg region has suspended branch secretary Thabiso Setona after images of him assaulting an elderly woman, understood to be a Black First Land First (BLF) member, emerged during the #HandsOffZuma march at Luthuli house on Monday. The branch secretary was captured by the media kicking the woman who got off a truck with BLF members participating in the march. “The African National Congress greater Johannesburg region has noted with dismay and utter disgust the images and videos circulating of Thabiso Setona. “As the ANC in the Johannesburg region, we have already taken a decision to suspend him with immediate effect and instructed the disciplinary committee to institute the disciplinary processes. Setona’s acts do not represent what the African National Congress stands for,” regional spokesperson Jolidee Matongo said. Following the incident, Setona handed himself over at the Johannesburg central police station. He is expected to appear in court on Tuesday to face charges of assault. Chaos erupted in Johannesburg on Monday between pro and anti-Zuma supporters at the ANC’s headquarters, with one side calling for his removal while the other called for the ANC to allow the president to finish his term.
