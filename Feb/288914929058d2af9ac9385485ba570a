The show will kick off at the Cape Town Stadium on Friday, February 9, with the second show taking place at Nasrec Expo in Johannesburg on Saturday, February 10. Ultra Festival SA is part of the Ultra worldwide series of events in countries and venues such as the US, Argentina, Bali, Brazil, Ibiza, Japan and Korea. The premier electronic music event was founded in Miami by Russel Faibisch and Alex Omes in 1999. Last year, it attracted more than 165000 music enthusiasts to the sold-out waterfront event in the heart of Miami. The music series was also recently voted the world’s number one festival by DJ Mag for the second consecutive year. The Ultra and Ultra Worldwide brands represent not only the world’s biggest and most successful remaining indie-electronic music festivals but also the most successful international festival in the world. Event organisers continue to transport the unrivalled experience from the Miami flagship festival to an ever-growing number of destinations and Ultranauts all over the globe. Each new global edition has been founded using the same successful recipe that has been perfected over 19 years in Miami, combining the most diverse electronic talent with the most technologically advanced, large-scale festival productions in the world. siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
