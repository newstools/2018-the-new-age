The portfolio committee on mineral resources in Parliament has extended its condolences to the families of two mine workers who died at Sibanye-Stillwater‘s Kloof mine on the West Rand in Gauteng on Wednesday. Sibanye-Stillwater confirmed the death of the two miners on Wednesday morning. The pair were trapped underground following a fall of ground at the mine. Committee chairperson Sahlulele Luzipo said the death of the two miners was shocking, particularly in light of an incident a week ago where over 950 workers were trapped underground at Sibanye Gold mine. “Although initial reports are that the deaths occurred as a result of a seismic event at the mine, the committee has always emphasised that more investment should be put into researching new technologies to improve and strengthen health and safety,” Luzipo said. Luzipo said companies who failed to put mechanisms in place to prevent the loss of lives in mines should be punished. -TNA Reporter
