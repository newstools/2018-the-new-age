ACCESS to treatment for oncology patients in rural Kwazulu-Natal is a matter of concern, according to a parliamentary oversight body. “The lack of SMAs for the maintenance of oncology equipment has led to the collapse of oncology services in Kwazulu-Natal,” Parliament’s health portfolio committee said in a report that considered the findings of the SA Human Rights Commission on the treatment of cancer patients in the province. The committee perused a response from Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi, as well as one from the KZN MEC for health. In its report on oncology in KZN to the National Assembly, the committee also flagged the shortage of health professionals, especially specialists in the province and the instability in the provincial health department due to senior management positions not being filled, as well as the long backlog of patients waiting for treatment. The committee also said that at certain hospitals newly installed radiotherapy equipment could not be used because staff were not trained to use them. It recommended that Motsoaledi through the provincial health department reviews the cost-cutting measures introduced in the KZN health department to ensure that the quality of service delivery was not compromised. Motsoaledi was also urged to ensure that the KZN health authorities also document the reasons for the resignation of health professionals to address these challenges. Additionally exit interviews must also be held with those health professionals who quit. The KZN health department was also instructed to develop and implement a plan “to ensure that cancer patients in rural areas have access to cancer treatment”. Staff should also be taught how to use equipment, while critical posts should be filled “to ensure that existing backlogs and waiting lists for care are shortened”, the portfolio committee recommended. news@thenewage.co.za -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
