Australia’s scandal-hit deputy leader Barnaby Joyce announced Friday he was quitting and moving to the backbench amid claims of sexual harassment and controversy over an affair with a now-pregnant former aide. Joyce, whose National Party rules alongside Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s Liberals, said he would officially step down on Monday. “I will say on Monday morning at the party room (meeting), I will step down as the leader of the National Party and deputy leader of Australia,” he said at a press conference.
