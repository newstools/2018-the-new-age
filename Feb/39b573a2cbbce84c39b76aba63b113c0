ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule and his deputy Jessie Duarte delivered a formal letter to former party’s president and current head of state Jacob Zuma at his official residence in Mahlamba Ndlopfu. The letter served as a formal communication which sought to inform him about the outcome of Monday’s National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting held in Irene just outside Pretoria.

It is reported that the talks between the two statesmen came to a halt on Monday evening when Zuma told Ramaphosa and Party’s Secretary General Ace Magashule that he will not resign as the country’s president. According to reports, Zuma’s decision did not sit well with some of the party’s senior members who made sure that they fast track the decision to recall him. It was then agreed that the president will be given 48hrs to resign or face a motion of no confidence. It is also expected that Zuma will not go down without a fight, as he intends to respond to the NEC’s decision. Magashule has confirmed that President Zuma has been recalled and that they await his response. -Sipho Jack
