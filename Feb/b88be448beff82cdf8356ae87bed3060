The ANC on Monday called on those planning to participate in the #HandsOffZuma march at Luthuli House in Johannesburg to do so lawfully. A march, led by Black First Land First (BLF), is taking place outside the ANC’s headquarters today, aimed at defending President Jacob Zuma who is allegedly being forced to resign. The BLF said Zuma should remain in his position until the end of his term, for him to implement all the programmes that he had started, including free education. “BLF supports the call by progressive civil society organisations to stop the focus on removing President Jacob Zuma. We say #HandsOffZuma, implement land expropriation without compensation now,” BLF said in a statement “We have received reports of planned marches to Luthuli House. We hope that they followed all by-laws. As ANC, we have not planned a march,” ANC communications manager Khusela Sangoni said. The march was responded to by other members of the ANC who plan to counter the mass action. Convener of the #ZumaMustFall march Bishop Maumela said that marchers were ready to defend the ANC from a “group of thugs” who threatened the party leadership. “We are ready for you. If you say that when the top six is going to recall Zuma you are going to touch them, we will finish you before you can even finish them, Maumela said. Maumela said that if Zuma did not resign, they would embark on a nationwide strike, together with other civil organisations – which would lead to a national shut down. We trust those who protest today will do so in a manner that does not undermine the genuineness or otherwise of their cause. #LuthuliHouse — African National Congress (@MYANC) February 5, 2018 #ANC respects & will always uphold the right of all citizens to protest, in a disciplined & peaceful manner, on any matter. #LuthuliHouse — African National Congress (@MYANC) February 5, 2018 -TNA Reporter
