JOHANNESBURG Water says its target is to create 1 391 job opportunities within the 2017-18 financial year. To date, a total of 540 job opportunities have been created against a mid-year target of 625. “This represents 86.4% of the target. More additional sewer work packages and the Vuk’uphile learnership programme will assist to catch up on the annual target,” member of the mayoral committee for environment and infrastructure services department, Nico de Jager, said. He said Johannesburg Water midterm performance report for the financial year 2017-18 ending in June this year highlighted progress towards their annual set targets. “The company remains committed to achieving its goals under challenges and budgetary constraints to deliver water and sanitation services to the residents of the city of Johannesburg,” he said. De Jager said in terms of service delivery targets, the company has realised the response time to sewer blockages was 93.68% against a target of 96%, response time to water bursts was 88.51% against a target of 95%, drinking water quality compliance is 99.9% against a target of 99% and water consumption per capita a day was 288.11 against a target of 299. “This is a positive trend towards the national average of 274 litres per capita a day,” he said. De Jager announced that a total of 2 888 prepaid meters were installed against a target of 3 140, representing 92% achievement. The cumulative number of prepaid meters installed since resumption of the project was 150 581. He said projects that were completed this financial year included pipe replacement in Zondi, construction of Orange Farm Reservoir (which was launched last week), Mountain View bulk water supply, emergency repairs in New Canada and Lenasia, South East Basin: Upgrade Sewer. “Johannesburg Water has embarked on the construction of eight new reservoirs for completion in 2019. “The purpose is to increase water storage capacity and for the company to meet the continuous demand and sustainable water supply for the residents of the city,” De Jager said. ntombin@thenewage.co.za -NTOMBI NKOSI
