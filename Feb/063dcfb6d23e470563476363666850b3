A male suspect is due to appear at the Jeppestown Magistrate Court on Tuesday for illegally connecting the power supply to a business complex he is in charge of. The 50-year-old man was arrested during Operation Buya Mthetho, which was conducted by the SAPS, JMPD and the city of Johannesburg’s Group Forensic and Investigation Service (GFIS). Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba said the business complex in Bruma, east of Johannesburg, owed the city about R7.5 million for rates and services. “The team visited the complex two weeks ago during Operation Buya Mthetho and it was found that the electricity was illegal. The city’s technicians cut off power supply but when they returned on Monday they found that the power was reconnected again,” Mashaba said. Operation Buya Mthetho is a new multi-departmental operation aimed at enforcing by-laws and bringing the rule of law to the city of Johannesburg. Mashaba has instructed the JMPD to continue monitoring properties found to be connecting to services illegally. He also said that if it was found that the power is connected illegally, owners of those properties would have to be arrested immediately. -TNA Reporter
