The Mookgopong magistrate’s court has on Friday found controversial “prophet” Lethebo Rabalago guilty on five charges of assault with intent to do grievously bodily harm as well as contravention of the 1947 Agricultural Remedies Act. Lethebo, also known as the “Prophet of Doom,” first made headlines when a video circulated on social media showing him spraying doom on his congregants to heal them. According to reports, Lethebo said he used doom to heal people suffering from diseases like cancer and HIV. In March last year, the Limpopo High Court ordered that Lethebo stop using insecticide on churchgoers. The Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL Rights Commission) has said the court outcome will probably vindicate what it has always said, that there are a number of religious leaders who violate the dignity of people and in the process, abuse their belief systems. “We have also repeatedly said that there aren’t enough laws, unless and until the victims stand up against these abuses,” the commission said in a statement. -TNA Reporter
