Remedial works at Orchards Clinic in Orange Grove are expected to commence on Monday. This comes after the Johannesburg Development Agency (JDA) finalised a design solution for design-related issues that were identified by a specialist engineer. Last year, the JDA suspended construction works following allegations of structural under-design by the appointed engineer. The JDA said an independent engineer was appointed in March 2017 to investigate the validity of the allegations and the investigation was completed in August 2017. “The findings revealed that some of the structural members of the building such as the beams and columns for the basement were under-designed,” the JDA said. Acting Chief Executive Officer of the JDA Christo Botes said: “The corrective work will take about six months to complete from the start date. The clinic is planned for completion in November 2018 when it will be handed to the health department of the city of Johannesburg.” The contract with the previously appointed structural engineers has been terminated and a legal process to claim certain damages from the firm is currently underway. -TNA Reporter
