The inquiry into the Lily mine tragedy has been concluded and a report will be submitted to the Department of Mineral Resources in the next few weeks. This was announced by Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane in Cape Town while delivering the opening address at the 2018 Mining Indaba. “We would all agree that closure and finality is critical on this matter, especially for the
families of Ms. Yvonne Mnisi, Ms. Pretty Nkambule and Mr. Solomon Nyerende,” Zwane said. On 5 February 2016, a shaft at Lily mine in Barberton, Mpumalanga, collapsed leaving the three miners trapped. Despite numerous attempts, rescue operations failed. Recovery operations to retrieve the bodies of the trapped miners have also been beset with a set of challenges. Last year, the families of the miners were paid R200 000 each 15 months after the tragic accident. Meanwhile, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) is hosting an event to commemorate the Lily mine tragedy. Never forget Yvonne Mnisi, Pretty Nkambule and Solomon Nyerende. #LilyMine #recoverthecontainer pic.twitter.com/Qhddm7DcCf — Amcu (@_AMCU) February 5, 2018 Lily Mine Remembrance.

We will intensify our support to them in 2018, in partnership with development finance institutions and the established mining industry.” -TNA Reporter
