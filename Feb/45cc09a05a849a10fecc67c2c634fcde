The Gauteng department of education has filed papers with the Constitutional Court seeking to overturn a North Gauteng High Court ruling that barred the department from enrolling 55 additional pupils at Hoërskool Overvaal for the 2018 academic year. Last month, Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi stated that the department would be approaching the court directly, seeking to reverse Judge Bill Prinsloo’s ruling after he set aside the department’s decision to enroll more students at the school. Gauteng education department spokesperson Steve Mabona confirmed that the department has indeed made its submission. “Yes, I can confirm that we have filed our papers at the Constitutional Court on the Hoërskool Overvaal matter,” Mabona said. -TNA Reporter
