SOUTH Africa’s controversial award-winning film Inxeba: The Wound’s opening weekend was hampered when 16 cinemas, most of them in the Eastern Cape and Cape Town, were unable to screen the film. However, that was not enough to stop the film from doing well in the local box office as it managed to take home just more than R600 000 with just 19 screens instead of the usual 55 screens. Inxeba, which stars actor, musician and author Nakhane Touré has been confirmed as South Africa’s first film to be available on the world’s largest streaming service, Netflix in the US. However South Africans will have to wait until February 12, once its cinema run is complete, to access it. The announcement comes after its launch in South Africa was interrupted by protests that resulted in the movie not being screened in some cinemas. The film’s director, John Trengove, has promised to beef up security and continue showing the film in spite of criticism. Ster-Kinekor is reportedly working with the police and mall security to prevent potential protests at its cinemas. “Inxeba will continue playing in cinemas despite disruptions at some sites. We promise that everyone who wants to see Inxeba will have the chance to do so, if not in cinemas then online or on the DVD release,” Trengove said. siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
