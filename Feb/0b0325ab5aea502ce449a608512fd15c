THE ANC in KwaZulu-Natal will host welcome home bash for recalled president Jacob Zuma to thank him for his 60 years of service to the country and the party, coordinator of the provincial interim committee, Sihle Zikalala, said in Durban yesterday. Zikalala said the functions would be attended by members of society who looked to Zuma for his “brave leadership”, more especially his pro-poor policies like free education, rural development and radical economic transformation stance. “As the province of KZN we will be hosting welcome back celebration for President Zuma to thank him for his 60 years of revolutionary service to the people of the country. “We call upon all the people from all sectors of society to join us as we thank this son of the soil. As the ANC we will even be more richer with his wisdom and experience and shall always continue to seek his guidance- we are happy with the solid legacy and the foundation he has laid,” Zikalala said. The province’s ANC Women’s League also praised Zuma’s policies saying his tenure had been marked by “drastic changes in terms of women’s lives especially the poor in the deep rural areas and the working class”. The league’s provincial secretary, Nonhlanhla Gabela, said the lives of women in provinces such as Eastern Cape, Limpopo and KZN had improved through access to water and electricity. The league also called for the ANC to align its presidential term to that of the country to avoid a repeat of the friction and conflict caused by two centres of power where the president of the country and the ANC were different persons. Both Zikalala and Gabela pledged to support for the newly elected President Cyril Ramaphosa saying that they accepted the recall of Zuma by the party. Details of the welcome home rally are yet to be finalised. provinces@thenewage.co.za -SIHLE MAVUSO
