City of Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille has thanked supporters who went to the Western Cape High court to give hear a support in her fight with the DA. De Lille is challenging the speaker’s decision to have a motion of no confidence against her without a secret ballot. The motion is scheduled for Thursday. “The support means a lot to me during this time. I am very grateful for all the support at the High Court today,” De Lille said. She said all councillors should feel free to express their views without any intimidation, hence her urgent application to the court demanding that the vote is done through a secret ballot. “There have been attempts to intimidate me and asking me to withdraw the matter but I am going ahead because at this stage only the court can ensure fairness.” De Lille appointed EFF chairman Dali Mpofu to represent her. She and the DA have been involved in a nasty public spat following her refusal to heed a call for her to step down. On Monday while addressing the media, DA leader Mmusi Maimane said it was time for a new leadership to take over in the city of Cape Town. Maimane said while the situation was unprecedented for the party, they believe a new leadership is required to take the caucus forward and restore faith in the public in what has been the party’s shining model of governance. -TNA Reporter
