IN SPITE of sexual assault and immorality accusations, the Big Brother Nigeria franchise continues to be aired across Africa while the South African version was canned when a contestant sexually molested a female contestant in her sleep. In 2015, a housemate named Adams sexually assaulted Bexx while she was asleep following a night of heavy drinking in the Big Brother house. Following this incident Mzansi Magic acted swiftly and removed the two contestants from the show, took the female contestant for counselling and the show was called off. Last year, Big Brother Naija (formerly Nigeria) was caught in a sex scandal after Kemen was disqualified after he was caught on tape fondling Tboss’ breasts without her consent. Speaking to the Independent this week, Nigerian Afro-pop and high-life singer, Harrison Tare Okiri popularly called Harrysong, said the show needed to instil morals as children and their parents were watching and if married contestants cheated on their spouses on live television, the show was setting a bad example for the youth of Nigeria. Harrysong said parents were not amused by the nature of the content aired on Big Brother Naija, adding that the show’s producers needed to be conscious of this. When contacted by The New Age, M-Net’s and Mzansi Magic’s spokesperson Nondumiso Mabece said she is in no position to comment about the current season of Big Brother Naija but said Big Brother Mzansi will not be back on the small screen. “Mzansi Magic does not have Big Brother Mzansi on the schedule as the channel has launched a number of dramas and reality shows to cater to the viewers varied viewing appetites,” Mabece said. She said the reality show was not banned as it would be included in their schedule in the near future. “We will announce to the viewers when the channel decides to include the show on its schedule,” she said. -NONTOKOZO GXUMISA|nontokozog@thenewage.co.za
