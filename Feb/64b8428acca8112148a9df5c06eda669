The police in Hoedspruit outside Phalaborwa in Limpopo have launched an investigation after a man was mauled to death by lions at a game farm on Friday. The man’s half-eaten, lifeless body was discovered on a game farm. The police said the man’s remains were saved after the lions were discovered feasting on it before scattering at the sound of gunshots. “The police are also investigating the possibility that the deceased might have been a poacher after a hunting rifle was found in the vicinity of the scene. The process of identifying the deceased has already commenced and it might be made possible by the fact that his head is among the remains that were found on the scene,” the police said in a statement. Authorities have called on members of the public to assist with the identification of the victim by contacting the Hoedspruit police station. -TNA Reporter
