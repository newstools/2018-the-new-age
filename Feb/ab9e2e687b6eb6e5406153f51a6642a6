Three suspects are expected to appear in the Klerksdorp Magistrate’s Court on Thursday for the gruesome murder of 23-year-old police Constable Armand Wagner. The arrest of the three suspects, aged 27, 30 and 35, was made by the Klerksdorp Cluster Trio Task Team in partnership with Klerksdorp detectives. Lieutenant Colonel Adéle Myburgh said a motorist noticed the body of a man next to the road in Roosheuwel, Klerksdorp on Tuesday night. “On arrival at the scene, the body of the 23-year-old constable was discovered with multiple stab wounds,” Myburgh said. Lieutenant-General Baile Motswenyane congratulated the detectives for the sterling investigation that led to the arrest of the suspects. “Detectives will do everything in their power to ensure a successful prosecution by investigating, gathering and analysing evidence,” Motswenyane said. -TNA Reporter
