The national convener of the #ZumaMustGo march said the march would not leave the Union Buildings until President Jacob Zuma had announced his resignation. Hangwi Maumela was speaking during a media briefing on Sunday where details and an update on the march were revealed. The march is scheduled to take place on Monday from Burgers Park to the Union Buildings in Pretoria. The march was cancelled last week pending the outcome of the ANC’s NEC meeting, which was later cancelled after ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that he was having fruitful negotiations with Zuma on his imminent removal. The ANC has called another urgent NEC meeting which will take place on Monday. Maumela said 60 buses have been secured to ferry passengers to the march from across Gauteng. Meanwhile, Maumela has issued a stern warning to the ANC NEC not to choose Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma as a president or deputy president. “Dlamini Zuma was rejected by the congress in December. People don’t want her in the presidency. We know her credentials and experience but the NEC must not make a mistake of making her a president or deputy,” Maumela said. At the same time, Maumela has called on the ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule to issue a public apology for his recent remarks in which he referred to ousted former ANC chairperson in KwaZulu-Natal Sihle Zikalala as a chairman despite the dissolution of his chairmanship. “Ace Magashule has disrespected the ANC and South Africa. He cannot refer to Sihle as a chairman because he is not.” Maumela also called on all media practitioners not to go to work and to join other South Africans who will be marching. -TNA Reporter
