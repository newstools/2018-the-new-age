Another worker has died at the Sibanye-Stillwater mine in less than a week after the death of two other miners. “Sibanye-Stillwater (Tickers JSE: SGL and NYSE: SBGL) regrets to report that an employee was fatally injured while clearing a blocked ore pass at its Driefontein operations last night. “Sibanye-Stillwater expresses their deepest condolences to the deceased employee’s family, friends and colleagues,” Sibanye-Stillwater said in a statement. Earlier this month two miners died at the Sibanye-Stillwater Kloof mine in Gauteng. The death of the two miners triggered a call by Cosatu for a total shutdown of the mine operations until workers’ safety could be guaranteed. This was after a call by miners who feared for their safety at mines. In January this year, 1100 miners were trapped at Beatrix gold mine near Welkom in the Free State for more than 20 hours due to damage to Eskom cables caused by a severe storm in the area. Meanwhile, the company says that “Investigations into the incident by Sibanye-Stillwater management together with the Department of Mineral Resources and other relevant stakeholders are underway”. The mine further announced that operations in the affected area at the mine have been suspended while the investigation into the incident continues. -TNA Reporter
