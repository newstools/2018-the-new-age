The National African Federated Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Nafcoc) has welcomed the changes to the country’s executive as announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday. Nafcoc President Lawrence Mavundla said Nafcoc would like to especially welcome Ramaphosa’s decision to keep Lindiwe Zulu as Minister of Small Business Development. “We reiterate the statement we made when Ramaphosa was elected, that the urgent task facing political leadership in the country is to restore investor confidence, create jobs, reinvigorate growth and address poverty and inequality,” Mavundla said. Nafcoc said it is hoping that the new team appointed will be alive to the challenges and acquit themselves diligently. “We will be engaging with Minister Zulu soon for us to reset the agenda for small business development.” He said that the issues of economic inclusion and transformation could not be delayed anymore. -TNA Reporter
