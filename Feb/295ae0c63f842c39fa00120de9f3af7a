KwaZulu-Natal ANC Interim Committee Coordinator Sihle Zikalala has said the party in the province would support and defend party President Cyril Ramaphosa. Zikalala said there were people in the province who wanted to divide the organisation, adding that they were now gunning for its newly-elected president. “There are those who want to divide the ANC and are going for President Cyril Ramaphosa. We are going to close ranks and rally behind him,” Zikalala said. He said the ANC in the province would continue to support the newly-elected leadership under the stewardship of Ramaphosa. The provincial coordinator was addressing the media in Pietermaritzburg. The party in the province was also informing its members that it would be organising a welcoming back celebration for former President Jacob Zuma. Zuma resigned from office as head of state on Wednesday evening after the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) recalled him on Tuesday. During the briefing, Zikalala described the former president as a loyal, disciplined and inspirational leader. He said the party in the province would be richer with him in the province. “As the ANC, we will be richer with his wisdom and experience and shall always continue to seek his guidance. We are happy with the solid legacy and the foundation he has laid.” -Sipho Jack
