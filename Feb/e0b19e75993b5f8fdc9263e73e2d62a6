KAIZER Chiefs players appear to be in the dark regarding the future of coach Steve Komphela. The future of Komphela from next season has been a topic of much speculation, as his tenure has remained trophyless for three years. The pressure to deliver will undoubtedly rack up even more if Chiefs fail to win either the PSL or Nedbank Cup, the only two remaining titles still on offer this season. Yesterday, midfielder Siphiwe Tshabalala and left back Philani Zulu were unsure of whether their coach will still be around at Naturena next season. “I think it is a reality, it is football, it is business. When you are not doing well and it is not working out there is nothing we can do. At the moment, we love our coach,” Tshabalala said. “We are working for our coach and we want him to stay. We believe that he is the right coach and the only thing we need to do now is to win trophies. When you win trophies, we will definitely keep him here.” Tshabalala said the only way they can show that they support the coach is to at least win one of the remaining trophies on offer. “It is not desperation but it’s a situation we currently found ourselves in. But at the moment we are not thinking about that.” Zulu, who has been enjoying his football at Amakhosi having worked with Komphela at Maritzburg United, was also not sure if Komphela would stay or go when the season ends. “For now I believe I’m doing a great job playing at left back and the coach saw that while we were at United,” Zulu said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen if the new coach comes. I’m not sure if will continue playing me where I’m used to or if he will put me in a new position, but I just have to accept whatever comes.” Chiefs are still in with a chance to win the league title but will need log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns to collapse in their remaining 10 matches as they are seven points behind. They host Cape Town City at FNB Stadium tomorrow desperate for three points. -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
