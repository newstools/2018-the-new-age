DA shadow health MEC in Gauteng Jack Bloom has said the police must speed up investigations into the Life Esidimeni tragedy. Bloom said he came to this conclusion after a visit to the Mosego Home where party members were confronted with contradictory information relating to the cause of the deaths of seven Life Esidimeni patients. “This NGO took 63 patients from Life Esidimeni in mid-2016 and an inspection by the Health Ombudsman’s office found that they were housed in unsuitable conditions, which could have caused the deaths of seven of them,” Bloom said. He said the visit further revealed irregularities relating to operating licenses of the NGO and another in Soweto. “An additional irregularity is that the Takalani Home in Soweto was registered and managed under Mosego’s license, which was also issued illegally. According to evidence from the Esidimeni arbitration hearings, there were many deaths at Takalani as well as cases of typhoid and an alleged rape.” Over 140 mentally ill patients died after being transferred from Life Esidimeni to different NGO facilities in 2016. According to Health Ombudsman Malegapuru Makgoba, most of the patients died of starvation and a lack of water. -TNA Reporter
