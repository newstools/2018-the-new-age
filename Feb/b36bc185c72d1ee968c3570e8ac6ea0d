The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) on Tuesday slammed the opposition party’s call for cabinet resignations and dissolution of Parliament. Sanco labelled this move as a ‘desperate attempt’ to claim relevance. This comes after the call by opposition parties including the EFF, DA and COPE. The opposition collaborated in their quest for Parliament to be dissolved to allow space for fresh elections of a new president of the country. “The opportunism is informed by their fears of ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa‘s much-anticipated ascension to the helm of government. “His ability to reconnect with the masses and inspire public confidence in the ruling party has evaporated their hopes to erode the ruling party’s electoral support ahead of the 2019 elections,” SANCO National Spokesperson, Jabu Mahlangu said. EFF said that they are exercising two clauses, Sec 102 and 50 of the Constitution to remove a President and Dissolve Parliament and go on early Election. However, Sanco says that this move by the opposition parties is an expression of a frustration. “Though opposition parties have called for the removal of Zuma as President, it is evident that they have also realised that such an eventuality will deny them the political mileage they have been deriving since his marathon court cases, as well as allegations of state capture and the so-called Gupta leaks, emerged,” Mahlangu said. -TNA Reporter
