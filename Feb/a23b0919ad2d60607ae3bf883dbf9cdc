The SACP in Gauteng wants Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to investigate city of Johannesburg Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba on recent allegations of corruption leveled against him. “Our principled call for an investigation follows revelations that Mashaba allegedly enlisted the services of his wife’s business to assist the Johannesburg metropolitan municipality in its official government business. A formal letter has already been sent to the Public Protector through our local district of Linda Jabane,” the SACP said in a statement. This week, the mayor was reported to have enlisted the services of his wife’s firm Lephatsi Financial Services to do business with the city. Mashaba has denied these allegations and made a clarification on Tuesday that there was no contractual obligation that was entered into between the alleged company that is reported to be linked to his wife’s company and the city. Mashaba said that company did the work for the city pro bono. “We are deeply shocked by his ridiculous and frivolous claim that his wife’s company did not draw any financial benefit from the deal, thus suggesting a “free lunch” with a business person. We are convinced that Mashaba’s wife’s company will unfairly benefit and earn a reputational dividend that the company can from other business deals.” Furthermore, Mashaba announced on Wednesday that he had also referred himself to the Council of Johannesburg’s Ethics Committee on the allegations. However, the SACP wants the deal to be investigated by the Public Protector because it “smells of corruption.” “It is our considered view that this deal, which smells of corruption, must be investigated as a matter of urgency.” “We urge the working class in Johannesburg to rise in defense of their hard-won democracy and not to allow our city to be corrupted and looted by the DA parasites as it is happening in Cape Town.” -TNA Reporter
