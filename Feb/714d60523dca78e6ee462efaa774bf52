The ANC in Joburg has condemned the assault of an elderly woman by one of its own members. Images of a man, since identified as ANC Branch Secretary in Inner City, Zone 12, Thabiso Setona on Monday went viral as he was captured kicking a woman in the back after she fell off the back of a van.  Your ANC kicks women while they’re down. This is a perfect Illustration of how women in our beloved country South Africa is being treated on the daily. Trash. Sies. #ANC #LuthuliHouse @thedailyvox pic.twitter.com/CnLKYDU7Oa — Felix The Cat (@GraceXOKelley) February 5, 2018 “As the ANC in Joburg, we strongly condemn any acts of violence against any person, more so women. The ANC Greater Joburg does not subscribe to the notion of people violently assaulting those who hold contrasting political views,” regional spokesperson Jolidee Matongo said in a statement. Setona and a number of supporters had gathered in the Joburg CBD to counter a planned march by a coalition of organisations including those who are calling for President Jacob Zuma to remain in office. Clashes broke out when members of the BLF and ANC supporters met outside close to the ANC headquarters. Images of Setona have sparked an outrage, particularly on social media with many calling for Setona to be arrested and taken to task. However, the ANC has attempted to distance its self from the incident saying Setona’s actions don’t represent those of the party. “Thabiso Setona’s acts do not represent what the African National Congress stands for, and as a consequence of his revolting behavior, he will face a disciplinary process hastily,” said Matongo. -TNA Reporter
