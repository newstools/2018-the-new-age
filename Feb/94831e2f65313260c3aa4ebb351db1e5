Eskom on Wednesday cut off the power supply in the Tokologo municipality in the Free State due to non-payment. The power cut took effect from 6am to 8am. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said, should there still be no payment on Wednesday, the power utility would initiate a second round of power cuts, which would run from 5pm to 7.30pm. “Eskom reserves the right to cut off power supply altogether if no payment is received or no settlement agreement is reached after 15 working days,” Phasiwe said. According to Eskom, the municipalities in the province owe a sum of R6 billion, which is more than half of the total R12 billion debt owed by all municipalities in the country. Phasiwe said the municipality failed to honour its payment agreement that was signed late last year, adding that the municipality’s failure to do so left Eskom with no choice. He further said there would be more power cut in the Masilonyana municipality on 28 February, due to non-payment as well. The municipality is said to owe Eskom an amount estimated at R50 million. -TNA Reporter
