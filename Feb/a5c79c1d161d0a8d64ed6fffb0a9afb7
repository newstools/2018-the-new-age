The City of Johannesburg is saddened by the death of yet another Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) officer who was shot in Tembisa last night. The incident happened just barely a month after JMPD buried three of its officers in a hit and run search and stop roadblock in Johannesburg. Johannesburg City Mayor Herman Mashaba expressed disbelief and dismay towards the incident. “I am bitterly disappointed and angered that yet another one of our officials has lost their lives while attempting to serve and protect. This is the fourth death in the JMPD in less than a month, and it must be stopped,” Mashaba said. He said that he has asked the province’s Police Commissioner, Deliwe de Langer to assist in tracking down the suspects and make sure the suspects are arrested and brought to book. The Mayor further said the commissioner assured him that the police will do all in their power to ensure the perpetrators are found and held to account. According to the City of Joburg, the officer witnessed an armed robbery near Busy Corner in Ivory Park when he tried to intervene. Upon realising the man the suspects opened fire on him resulting in him being shot in the arm and chest. “Immediately after the incident occurred, the Acting Regional JMPD Commander called all officers on duty to barricade the area in search of the suspects. Unfortunately, no arrests have been made.” At the same time, the mayor asked JMPD David Tembe, to set up a task team consisting of all JMPD Directors and to call an urgent meeting with SAPS to find a solution to the crisis the Department is currently facing. The officer died at the scene. -TNA Reporter
