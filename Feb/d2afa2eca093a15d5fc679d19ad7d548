EFF leader Julius Malema has on Thursday said that former President Jacob Zuma resigned because he feared being embarrassed by his party’s motion of no confidence. He said those who told Zuma that he has been recalled were afraid of him and that is why they did not tell him why he had to go. The 75-year-old on Wednesday tendered his resignation following calls from the opposition and the ANC for him to step down. Addressing the nation from the Union Buildings, Zuma made the announcement as he was due to face his ninth motion of no confidence on Thursday. Zuma served in his capacity as president of the ANC and state from 2009. Malema outlined the reasons why Zuma was recalled: Malema: It was under Jacob Zuma that the Executive was unnecessarily ballooned and used a means to dispense patronage and handover government to incompetent and corrupt individuals. #EFFPresser — EFF (@EFFSouthAfrica) February 15, 2018 Malema: It was under Jacob Zuma that the State was forced to begin with procurement of unaffordable Nuclear energy, which would have collapsed South Africa’s BUDGET. #EFFPresser — EFF (@EFFSouthAfrica) February 15, 2018 It was under Jacob Zuma that the corruptly awarded tender to distribute social grants was declared legally & constitutionally invalid and therefore threatening the stability of the country. SASSA is a crisis waiting to happen due to corrupt practices which ZUMA is party to. — EFF (@EFFSouthAfrica) February 15, 2018 Malema: It was under Jacob ZUMA that public healthcare totally collapsed, signified with the Life ESIDEMENI massacre and many other public healthcare institutions that have collapsed. #EFFPresser — EFF (@EFFSouthAfrica) February 15, 2018 Malema: It was under Jacob Zuma that Government debt grew by leaps and bounds to the extent that currently, the State spends more than R200 billion annually servicing debts. — EFF (@EFFSouthAfrica) February 15, 2018
