The EFF national leadership has instructed members in Nelson Mandela Bay to start impeachment proceedings against Mayor Athol Trollip. This comes after the party’s President Julius Malema announced in Parliament – during the tabling of a motion on the expropriation of land without compensation – that the EFF would instruct its leadership in the province to prepare to table a motion as a warning shot to the DA on its position on land expropriation. “On 6 April, the day of Jan van Riebeeck’s arrival in the Cape, the day of the formation of the PAC by Robert Sobukwe and on the anniversary of Solomon Mahlangu‘s hanging, the EFF will table a motion of no confidence against the mayor of PE,” Malema said. EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu also warned the DA about the same being done in Tshwane and Johannesburg if the DA continued with its position. Malema said if the ANC failed to bring a credible candidate, the EFF would abstain from voting as it was not forced to do so. DA Eastern Cape leader Nqaba Bhanga said it was clear that the EFF was placing its politics ahead of the needs of Nelson Mandela Bay residents, adding that the party’s “political schizophrenia” would only harm residents of the metro. Bhanga said, when the DA campaigned in the 2016 municipal elections, it was on the basis of bringing total change to the city. “It is clear that the EFF would like to see the ANC return to its old ways of looting the municipality and lying to the people,” Bhanga said. He said for the EFF to suggest that the ANC had the ability to present a credible candidate was unthinkable as many of the country’s problems are of the ruling party’s making, irrespective of who led the organisation at all levels. -TNA Reporter
