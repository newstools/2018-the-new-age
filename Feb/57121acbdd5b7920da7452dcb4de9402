The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) announced on Wednesday that the party has postponed its urgent court application for a motion of no confidence to be brought forward against President Jacob Zuma. “The EFF has postponed its Urgent Court application for a Motion of No Confidence to be brought forward following engagements with the ruling party caucus in parliament,” reads the statement. This follows engagements with the ruling party caucus in parliament. The motion of no confidence against President Zuma tabled by the EFF was scheduled for 22 February after the State of the Nation address (SONA) which has since been postponed to a date yet to be announced. However, the EFF demanded that the motion must be conducted sooner because the ruling party was unsuccessful in persuading Zuma to step down. The party says that it has not abandoned the motion but only the urgent court application. The EFF Motion of No Confidence stands despite the postponement of our court application. We still demand that it must be brought forward and that is what we are talking to the ANC caucus about. — EFF (@EFFSouthAfrica) February 14, 2018 The EFF had also written to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to demand that the motion of no confidence against President Zuma be conducted through a secret ballot. The EFF had pointed, among others, the formal complaint to law enforcement and threats associated with the previous motion as grounds for a secret ballot. The party says that it is engaging the ANC in Parliament regarding the postponement of the court application. “The public will be advised as soon as these engagements are concluded.” -TNA Reporter
