The South African Reserve Bank(SARB) has confirmed that it received a notice of exit from South Africa by Bank of Boroda. The Reserve Bank said it is in discussions to ensure orderly withdrawal from the country that will not disadvantage the bank’s depositors. The SARB was responding to reports announcing the bank’s imminent departure from South Africa at the end of March. “At this stage, the SARB has no further comments on the matter.” The Bank features very prominently in Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s State of Capture report. It currently operates branches in Johannesburg and Durban. Last year, the North Gauteng granted a multitude of Gupta family-owned businesses an interim order stopping it from closing their bank accounts pending the hearing of the main case where the family was contesting the closing of their accounts. -TNA Reporter
