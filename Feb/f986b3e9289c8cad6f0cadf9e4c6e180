Radio presenter and comedian Tumi Morake on Wednesday announced her departure from Jacaranda FM. Morake made the announcement during her Wednesday morning show. She said: “My performance career is taking a new direction and unfortunately radio, with the time and energy it requires at this level, doesn’t fit into those plans. I had a great time and learnt many valuable lessons, yes, even when the pawpaw hit the fan. I wouldn’t change it for the world.” Sometimes you need to stop, take stock, trim here and there and get back on course. It sucks to walk away from my newly found family. It’s goodbye, for now. pic.twitter.com/MyAotmyAP8 — Decaf (@tumi_morake) February 28, 2018 Morake joined Jacaranda FM as a co-anchor with Martin Bester in a new breakfast show on 3 July last year. “This was not an easy decision for me at all. The timing was just not right for this relationship, it is like leaving a lover that you are still in love with. I really hope that fate will bring us together again one day,” Morake said. Morake’s last official day on air will be 9 March. -TNA Reporter
