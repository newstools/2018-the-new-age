Orlando Pirates midfielder Abbubaker Mobara has returned to full fitness after he was declared fit and injury-free by the medical. The 24-year-old has been out since the beginning of the year due to a groin strain. He returns to training in the week when the team is preparing for the crucial clash against rivals Kaizer Chiefs in the Soweto derby on Saturday. Meanwhile, newly signed forward Augustine Mulenga is said to be making good progress with regards to his injury. According to the medical staff, the 27-year-old has been responding well to treatment but will need to undergo a late fitness test this week to determine his availability for the weekend. -TNA Reporter
