The DA has submitted an application to the Bloemfontein High Court seeking to force the legislature speaker to schedule its motion of no confidence against Premier Ace Magashule. The DA said Magashule’s election as ANC secretary-general, a post that requires him to be at the ANC’s headquarters on a full-time basis, should have prompted his immediate resignation as premier of the Free State. The party said recent events around the Vrede Dairy Farm Project, which saw a number of individuals and companies appear in court on criminal charges, was just one of many controversial issues that relate to his premiership and are additional reasons for a motion of no confidence. DA leader in the Free State legislature Roy Jankielsohn said the party had used every opportunity to constructively engage with the Speaker Mamiki Qabathe and Chief Whip of the Legislature Neels van Rooyen since 29 January, to no avail. “It appears that both the speaker and the chief whip of the legislature remain hell-bent to prevent the debate and vote on the motion,” Jankielsohn said. Jankielsohn said, since the DA’s submission to Qabathe on 29 January, she had failed to effectively decide on their request, deflecting responsibility to Van Rooyen, who according to the party is himself complicit in ensuring the extended delay in the granting the request. “It appears that not only is the speaker unwilling to hold her political principals to account in line with the legislature’s constitutional mandate but is deliberately frustrating the DA’s attempts to do so.” Jankielsohn said the Western Cape Division High Court had previously ruled that motions of no confidence were “inherently urgent” and they should “receive precedence” over other business. “In 2013, the Constitutional Court ruled that the National Assembly should correct its rules to make provision for matters of no confidence in line with the provisions of the Constitution.” -TNA Reporter
