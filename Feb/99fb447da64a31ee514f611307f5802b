THE alarming trend of mineworkers being killed in mines has triggered the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) to call for a mine safety summit. The union called for the summit following the recent death of another mineworker at one of Sibanye-Stillwater’s operations. “Amcu is calling on the Minister of Mineral Resources, Mosebenzi Zwane to urgently call a mine safety summit so that this shocking trend can be discussed further. “Amcu has consistently pointed out that there are certain regulatory shortcomings regarding health and safety standards at mines, ”the union said. This accident is the fourth fatality this month after a worker was crushed by a box of gold ore at the same operation last week. Earlier this month, two mineworkers were killed at Sibanye-Stillwater’s Kloof operations due to a fall of ground in another incident at the SibanyeStillwater’s Beatrix operations in the Free State. The union said it had received reports that a worker was electrocuted at Sibanye-Stillwater’s Driefontein operations outside Carletonville in Gauteng. The union has previously demanded that the Department of Mineral Resources steps up its game in setting regulations and ensuring compliance by the mining houses. Last month, about 1 000 miners were trapped at Beatrix gold mine near Welkom in the Free State for more than 20 hours due to damage to Eskom cables caused by a severe storm in the area. -KEITUMETSI MOTLHALE|keitumetsim@thenewage.co.za
