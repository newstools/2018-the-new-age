The social development department in Gauteng has confirmed it will host a healing session for the 144 grieving family members of the Life Esidimeni tragedy. This follows a request from the Life Esidimeni Family Committee for the premier’s office to host a session on behalf of the family members. The session will take place on Saturday at Freedom Park in Pretoria. The department said the session would give families, who have not yet told their stories, an opportunity do do so. “This platform also allows the provincial government to offer a public apology and to pledge that this will never happen again in our lifetime,” the department said. -TNA Reporter
