The Mining Charter application has been postponed after the Presidency and the Chamber of Mines agreed to postpone a court application. The Chamber of Mines has agreed, jointly with the Department of Mineral Resources, to postpone its court application in respect of the reviewed Mining Charter. The application was supposed to be start on Monday in the North Gauteng High Court. However, the Presidency said the postponement served to allow parties the space to engage and find an amicable solution. “I am certain we will be able to resolve the current impasse and agree on a charter that both accelerates transformation and grows this vital sector of our economy,” President Cyril Ramaphosa said in his State of the Nation Address on Friday. -TNA Reporter
