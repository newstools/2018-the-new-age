WHEN Anele Ngcongca left Belgium after spending more than a decade there, his biggest wish was to join a team that will dominate in every sense of the word. In Mamelodi Sundowns, Ngcongca felt he had found the perfect fit and even though the PSL operates very differently from what he was used to in Europe, he still feels he made the right choice. As the former Bafana Bafana captain is gearing up to face Free State Stars, his voice oozed optimism at the prospect of winning the PSL title. Even though Sundowns are the best financially backed team in the country, bankrolled by billionaire boss Patrice Motsepe, who is also the brother-inlaw of President Cyril Ramaphosa, the 30-year-old defender is annoyed by what he calls the “fake humility” in the league. At this stage of the season, where Sundowns are leading by four points with a game in hand, teams in Europe would have already stated clearly that the league is in the bag. Not here, as players choose “quiet diplomacy” instead of showing their intent. The whole setup irks the former Genk and Troyes man, who believes more in self-respect than “fake humility”. Ngcongca said players shouldn’t tiptoe around the need to win the title, especially when the big investment made by Motsepe to the side has to be considered. “I believe this league is ours. This diplomatic business must just end. “I agree 100% that we have to respect our opponents, but it must end there. “As a Sundowns player, what do you play for if not to win the league? You have been signed to win the league. The club is investing a lot. Second place for Sundowns is not enough. “We cannot hide behind this fake humility. It drops our standard. “I come from Europe and I am used to more aggressive talk.” Perhaps Free Stars coach Luc Eymael, who is from Belgium, will understand Ngcongca’s language better when he guides his side against the motivated log leaders at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium tonight at 7pm. -MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
