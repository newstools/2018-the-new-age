Members of the ANC top six will meet with President Jacob Zuma on Sunday amid speculation that he will be persuaded to step down. ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule confirmed that the top six leadership would be meeting with the president on Sunday. “We are not being pushed by anybody’s agenda. This is a meeting we have organised ourselves. We will be interacting with the president and we are not worried about other things that are out there in the public by opposition parties, not at all. President Zuma is a member of the ANC, he is the president of the country, we will be interacting with him during this weekend,” Magashule said. Amid calls from opposition parties for Zuma to be axed before the State of the Nation Address (Sona) on Thursday, Magashule is adamant the president will not leave office soon. Meanwhile, other members of the party have expressed their desire for Zuma to give up power. ANC Treasurer-General Paul Mashatile told CNBC Africa that Zuma should give up power as the party would not like to see him removed through a motion of no confidence. “We want to see a situation where there is one centre and no tensions and the best possible way is if the state president exits. How we do it is to engage with him and go to him and say look we are not booting you out but we think we can work better this way. One of the things that we obviously want to avoid as the ANC is to get our president, who was president of the ANC, to be moved out of government through a motion of no confidence or impeachment.” -TNA Reporter
