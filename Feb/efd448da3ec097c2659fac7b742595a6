The DA says it is happy with the arrest of former acting Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane. Phahlane, his wife Beauty and car salesman Durand Snyman appeared in the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Thursday to face charges of corruption and fraud. The three were released on R10 000 bail and will appear in court again on 12 March. The DA’s shadow minister of police Zakhele Mbhele said Phahlane would finally face the music for charges relating to cars the couple received, allegedly as part of a corrupt scheme as well as allegations that Crimetech Laboratories paid for his stereo system worth R80 000. Mbhele said the DA had repeatedly called for investigations into Phahlane and for him to submit himself to a voluntary lifestyle audit, which he diligently dodged. “This bodes well for holding Phahlane to account but the fact remains that those chosen to lead the South African Police Service need to be above reproach so that the public can trust that they will be committed to fighting the unacceptably high levels of crime in our country, not contribute to it,” Mbhele said. He said it was high time that Police Minister Fikile Mbalula prioritised the people of South Africa by ensuring that those entrusted to bring down crime rates had the skills and experience to do so. -TNA Reporter
