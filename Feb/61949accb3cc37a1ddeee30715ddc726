The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) on Wednesday expressed shock following the murder of five police officers and an off-duty soldier at the Ngcobo police station near Queenstown in the Eastern Cape. Sanco said the police should intensify its search of the people responsible for the crime. “No stone must be left unturned until the heartless criminals, whom we suspect are highly trained individuals, are behind bars,” Sanco national spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu said. Mahlangu has also wished the injured police officers a speedy recovery. According to the police, the unknown suspects entered the police station in the early hours of Wednesday morning and without warning, randomly opened fire on the members on duty. “Three members were killed instantly in the community service centre. An off-duty soldier was also shot dead as the suspects were fleeing. “The suspects made off with a police van, taking two other members. The bodies of both these members with gunshot wounds, were later found along the roadside, six kilometres from the police station,” Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said. Mahlangu said that no one within communities would be safe until the marauding violent gang was behind bars and the stolen weapons retrieved. “We cannot afford to have such barbaric, callous murderers roaming our streets and neighbourhoods with high calibre weapons and murderous intent. The brazen attack on Ngcobo police station has taken violent crime, which must be crushed, to an unprecedented and unacceptable level.” He said that an attack on police officials was an attack on the authority of the state and would need the united and collaborative effort of police and communities to be stamped out. “Corrupt police officers are an internal threat to the safety and the lives of their colleagues and must be uprooted from the ranks of the SAPS and other law enforcement agencies.” -TNA Reporter
