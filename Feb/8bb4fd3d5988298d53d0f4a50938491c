AS FOOTBALL fans in the country begin to mourn the death of talented football star Mogau Tshehla yesterday, his brothers Percy Tau and Dumisani Tau are said to be struggling with his loss. Tshehla, aged 26, who played as a right back for Polokwane City in the Premier Soccer League, was killed in a car accident while driving to Witbank, Mpumalanga, to visit his family. He was the older brother of Mamelodi Sundowns and Bafana Bafana striker Percy, as well as Royal Eagles striker Dumisani. Sundowns spokesperson Thulani Thuswa said Percy would get all the support the club could offer to deal with the sudden loss. “Percy is a strong character. All the Tau brothers played football together growing up. It is natural that the two brothers will find it hard to deal with their brother’s passing,” the Sundowns spokesperson said. “They were a very tight unit and Tau admired his big brother. He would always stay behind when he played in Polokwane just to have a chat with Mogau before the teams would leave the stadium.” The reason that Tshehla did not bear the Tau surname, even though they were born of the same mother and father, is because Tshehla used his sister’s marital surname. When Tshehla went to apply for an identity document he could not find his parents’ documentation and instead used his sister’s documents to apply for one. “Many people may not know this, but he was my brother but with a different surname,” Dumisani said. “My sister took care of him when he was growing up and there was a time when they wanted his ID and my mother’s ID was too far away and then my sister helped out. “It is why he was using Tshehla as his surname. I’m sad, his death is very difficult to take,” Dumisani said. Tshehla played eight games in all competitions for City since joining them at the beginning of last season. • Funeral arrangements were not available at the time of going to press. -MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
