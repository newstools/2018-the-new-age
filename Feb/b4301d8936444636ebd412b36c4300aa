Lead actor in the controversial movie Inxeba (The Wound), Nakhane Toure, has expressed his frustration over a decision by the Film and Publication Board (FPB) to “ban” the movie from playing at mainstream cinemas in South Africa. This comes after a decision by the FPB Appeal Tribunal that overturned the films’ classification rating of 16 LS – that was initially given to it – and gave it an X18 rating. As accordance to the latest revision, the movie will be “banned” from cinemas or any other platform and can only be distributed from designated adult premises. The actor expressed his disappointment in a social media post with an emotional message. The move by the FPB was criticised by industry players and politicians, including DA’s shadow communications minister Phumzile van Damme, who described the action as “very harsh”. “This is an effective ban. X18 means: only a holder of a licence to conduct the business of adult premises ie, it may only be shown at stores that have a licence to sell/allow viewing of pornographic material. Shame on you @FPB_ZA!,” van Damme said. The film has received criticism following its release with claims that it violates the sanctity of cultural practices, which by nature are secret. -TNA Reporter
