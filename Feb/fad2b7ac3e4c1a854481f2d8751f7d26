Water-saving efforts seem to be bearing fruit for the city of Cape Town as it was announced on Monday that Day Zero has been pushed further back to 9 July. The city has attributed the latest push to weekly drops in dam levels. Day Zero is the day water is expected to run out in the city of Cape Town. The city has also attributed the drop to this week’s lower consumption and Groenland water reaching Steenbras Upper Dam last week, slightly increasing the dam level, as well as a further reduction in the city’s weekly average demand to 523 megalitres per day. “The Groenland water transfer and the reduction in our weekly average demand has had a dramatic impact on the Day Zero date, which is determined by assuming that the fortnightly trend of weekly dam storage change will continue unchanged,” the city said in a statement. “This precautionary outlook assumes no further rainfall and that water demand may not reduce over the next few months. It has been adopted to allow sufficient lead time for the implementation of temporary water collection points in the event that these may be required.” The city said it anticipates the possibility of Day Zero moving back to June once the Groenland transfer has been completed, unless the 450MLD water usage target is met before the rainy season. -TNA Reporter
