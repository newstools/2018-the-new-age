Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor said the country’s constitution allowed the expropriation of land but with compensation. Pandor said President Ramaphosa was spot on during his Maiden State Of the Nation Address (SONA) on the land issue. “President Ramaphosa has hit the nail on the head on his Land sentiments. The constitution says there must be land with expropriation, but the constitution says there should be compensation and provide for redress.” She said if the people of the country are able to look at each other in the eye as they did during the negotiated settlement, they would find it easy to agree that those who hunger for land and wish to work it should be given some land. The country’s third-biggest opposition party the Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) do not share Pandor’s sentiments. EFF believes that there should be expropriation of land, but without compensation, as the land was taken forcefully by the “white settlers”. During the state of the nation address, EFF leader Julius Malema warned the Democratic Alliance (DA) to change its stance on expropriation of land without compensation, saying that failure to do that will result in them losing the metros. “I want to warn you, the leader of the opposition, that your stay in the metros is going to depend on your attitude on the expropriation of land without compensation and I want to warn you about that because that is a fundamental issue that is going to make us fight with you. “Because anyone who opposes expropriation of land without compensation is the enemy of our people and such a person will be dealt with,” Malema said. -Sipho Jack
