Office of the ANC Umkhonto We Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) has on Saturday distanced its President Kebby Maphatsoe from a fake Twitter account. The League said that Maphatsoe does not have any social account both as president nor at his capacity as Deputy Minister. “This serves to notify all and distance the President of MKMVA, Cde Kebby Maphatsoe from the fake twitter account and its posts. “Cde Kebby Maphatsoe does not have a Twitter or any social media account neither in his personal capacity nor as President of MKMVA or Deputy Minister of Defence and Military Veterans,” MKMVA said in a statement. Maphatsoe was a staunch supporter of Former President Jacob Zuma and he preferred Former African Union chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma to take over. Immediately, after the party’s January 8, there were talks to remove Zuma as seating president. The news did not sit well with Maphatsoe and the association. During a media conference the association held at the time, he said those who were calling for the President (Zuma) to step down were against the call made by the 54th conference, which instructed newly elected leadership to work towards rebuilding the organisation. “Delegates at the conference instructed leadership to work tirelessly for unity. We, therefore, call for unnecessary divisive pressure with regards to the future of President Jacob Zuma as president of the Republic of South Africa to be avoided.” -TNA Reporter
