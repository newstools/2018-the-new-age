Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services and Correctional Services has postponed its planned meeting which was, among others discuss Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane‘s remarks in recent times. On Tuesday Parliament House Chairperson of Committees Cedrick Frolick announced a delay in some of the committee meetings which were scheduled for today. The committee wanted Mkhwebane to explain some of her public utterances in recent times. Last week while releasing a report into investigations at the Estina Dairy Farm at Vrede in the Free State, Mkhwebane said she was unhappy with her own report as she did not conduct all interviews she wanted to conduct. She also called on the commission that would be investigating state capture not only to confine itself to her predecessor Thuli Madonsela’s State of Capture report but be broadened to include all forms of capture. Mkhwebane criticised the committee for announcing its wish to have her in parliament through the media before informing her. According to the committee chairperson Mathole Motshekga, the postponement comes as a result of a sudden amendment in the parliamentary programme. Motshekga said the delay gives the committee too little time to address the matters on the agenda. “The meeting will now take place on Tuesday 20 February. The Committee would like to apologise to anyone who might be inconvenienced by this change.” -TNA Reporter
