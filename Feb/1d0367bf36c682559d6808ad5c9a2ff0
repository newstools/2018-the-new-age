Newly appointed Police Minister Bheki Cele on Wednesday called on the criminal justice system to deal decisively with criminals. Speaking at a memorial service for five police officers and a soldier gunned down in Ngcobo, Cele said: “We cannot continue to bury police officers.” Warrant Officer Zuko Mbini, 45, Constable Zuko Ntsheku, 38, Nkosiphendule Pongco, 32, Sibongiseni Sondlana, 32 and Kuhle Metete, 27 were mowed down by a group of unknown men who entered the Ngcobo police station and randomly opened fire. Another victim who was hit and killed by a stray bullet near his home is retired soldier Freddy Mpandeni, 58, who lived close to the police station. The Ngcobo Methodist Church was at full capacity on Wednesday morning as the families of the deceased paid their last respects to the fallen heroes. The memorial service was honoured by different authorities, including members of the provincial legislature. Labour unions, members of the religious fraternity and media were also part of the divine service. During the memorial, Cele emphasised that the police would double efforts in fighting crime, adding that no criminal should be feared by the community. “I’m not saying they must shoot people but do what the law says. As policemen and women, we have to apply the law within the Constitution,” the police minister said. -TNA Reporter
