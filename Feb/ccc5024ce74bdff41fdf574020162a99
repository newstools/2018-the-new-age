Parliament’s portfolio committee on basic education says it was shocked to learn that a 13-year-old pupil had been abducted from Leonard Ntshuntshe Secondary School in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga. Committee members were informed by the school’s acting principal. Chairperson Nomalungelo Gina described incident as an act of criminality. “This is criminal. It is ridiculous that in this day and age people with albinism are not safe. We call on the community to stand together to assist in finding these children. It is the responsibility of everyone to ensure the safety of all children and learners. Children have the right to safety and security,” Gina said. The 13-year-old pupil was kidnapped on Monday evening by three men. The acting principal told the committee that the school was doing everything in its power to assist the teenager’s family during this difficult time. The committee has urged the authorities to leave no stone unturned to find the child alive. -TNA Reporter
