Limpopo police have positively identified the man who was allegedly killed by lions at the private game reserve in Hoedspruit on Friday last week. 50-year-old Mozambican national David Baloyi’s body was identified at Maphutha Malatji Hospital Mortuary in Namakgale outside Phalaborwa by his sister who resides in South Africa. Two of his accomplices allegedly ran away when they noticed a group of lions approaching them leaving him to face them alone. Limpopo police Spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said the woman received a call from her family members in Mozambique informing her that they have just been informed by the two men who were with her brother that he may have been killed by lions. “She confirmed to the family that she also heard over the radio that there is an unknown person who was killed by lions and community members who can assist with his identification, may go to Hoedspruit Police Station and she subsequently went to the Police Station and further proceeded to the Hospital mortuary.” Ngoepe said they are still investigating the possibility of the deceased being a poacher as a hunting rifle and ammunition were found nearby. He said an inquest docket has been opened by the police. -TNA Reporter
