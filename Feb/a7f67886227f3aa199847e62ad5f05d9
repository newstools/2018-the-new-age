The EFF on Wednesday embarked on a nationwide demonstration at different hospitals across the country, calling for better public healthcare. The party earlier this month announced that it would make the state of public healthcare in South Africa a focus point in 2018. EFF leader Julius Malema said the party wanted to do away with bad nurses and doctors. While addressing supporters and members of the public who engaged in the campaign at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Johannesburg on Wednesday, Malema said that while patients were ill-treated, some were made to give birth on benches at the hospital “because some arrogant health practitioner dismissed them willingly, because they are untouchable. We must expose them. We must make follow-ups so that they are disciplined.” “And those with stinking attitude are flushed from the system, we want a servant of the people,” Malema said. The EFF leader said the red berets were making sure that the country did not experience a repeat of the Life Esidimeni tragedy. He called on health practitioners to treat patients with a smile, even when telling them they have no medicine – and to stop discriminating against HIV/Aids patients. The demonstration ended with the CIC handing over a memorandum to the acting CEO the hospital.
