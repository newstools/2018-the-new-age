Three more suspects have been arrested for the robbery of a cash delivery vehicle near Groblersdal in Limpopo last week. The arrests bring the total of those apprehended to four. Limpopo police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said the police are still looking for seven more suspects. During the arrest, the police recovered a gun, a Ford Ranger, which is believed to be one of the cars used during the robbery and damaged money, which is believed to be some of the loot stolen during the robbery. Ngoepe said G4 Security Guards were approached by two vehicles, a Ford Ranger and Nissan X Trail, while travelling along Ramogwera Road. “Occupants of these cars started shooting at the security vehicle, injuring the driver in the leg, causing the vehicle to swerve off the road. He lost control and the vehicle came to a halt on the edge of the road,” Ngoepe said. He said the suspects then approached the vehicle and tried to open it but failed to do so. “When they realised that they could not open it, they disarmed the guards and ordered them to lie down on the ground.” “The scavengers then bombed the vehicle with explosives and managed to take an undisclosed amount of money before they fled the scene.” The suspects are expected to appear in the Motetema Magistrate’s Court on Monday where they will face a host of charges including armed robbery, illegal possession of a firearm and illegal possession of ammunition, among others. -TNA Reporter
