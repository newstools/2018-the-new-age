KAIZER Chiefs coach Steve Komphela is hoping for Mamelodi Sundowns to slip up in the PSL title race and for his side to take full advantage. This after Amakhosi moved into second on the log following a 1-0 victory over another title hopeful Cape Town City at FNB Stadium on Saturday. They are now four points behind Sundowns having played one more game. Komphela is confident about his team’s chances and said they would continue to fight until the last day of the season. “There is still a long way to go – nine matches. Too many points to play for. That we are challenging for the championship with the difference of four points, I can say that there is great optimism and hope. “We are looking forward to pushing, but Cape Town City is not far off, they just lost the match and can still keep pushing us and the leaders.” With his side unbeaten in all competitions this year, Komphela said they were happy with their league position. “The only time when you say it’s over is when mathematically you can’t make it. “Everybody is still in it. For us, the win is a great confidence booster and indication as well that we would love to win the trophy but it won’t come as easy as we think and wish. “We still need to dig deep and fight for it.” With striker Ryan Moon enjoying the best form of his life after netting the only goal on Saturday, Komphela also hopes the striker will continue with his scoring form until the end to help them. “He is unbelievable talented and apart from luck, he is ready to pounce at any given time.” Chiefs next play Bloemfontein Celtic at the FNB Stadium on Saturday. -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
