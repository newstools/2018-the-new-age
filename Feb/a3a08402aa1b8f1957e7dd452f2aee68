POLICE Minister Fikile Mbalula has dismissed media reports that he orchestrated a plot to defraud Crime Intelligence. Sunday newspapers reported that the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) is conducting an investigation into a failed plot, which would have seen Crime Intelligence funds pay for votes at the ANC elective conference in December 2017. According to these reports, Ipid suspects that Minister Mbalula, his adviser Bongani Mbindwane and national police commissioner Khehla Sitole were involved in the scheme. All parties have strongly rejected these claims. “Let me make it categorically clear that the idea that I would summon police generals into a corruption plotting meeting is an insult to me and the generals, who are outstanding law enforcers. I did not attend any such meetings whatsoever. I condemn and deny the allegations with the contempt they deserve,” the Minister said yesterday. Besides his normal functions as minister, Mbalula said he was also assigned ANC work, which he reported directly to ANC officials and the conference steering committee. The minister said the allegations come from “purveyors of paranoia and information peddlers”. The ANC conference, according to the minister, went ahead without any undue influence or vote buying, as the delegates were of “high discipline”. As such, Minister Mbalula emphasised that there was no money exchanged in the conference venue or at the delegates’ places of accommodation. news@thenewage.co.za -TNA REPORTER
