The DA says it will write to Minister of Sports and Recreation Thulas Nxesi to ask for clarity on what happened and whether an attack on South African athlete Thabang Mosiako was racially motivated. Mosiako sustained a head injury and is recovering in hospital after he and two of his friends were attacked, allegedly by white men, in what is believed to be a racially motivated attack. He was kicked and had his head bashed into the ground by a group of about 10 white North West University students on 4 February. DA shadow minister of sports and recreation Tsepo Mhlongo said the party was calling on the SAPS to find the men responsible for the crime and to get to the bottom of the motives for the assault. “We also note reports that when the SAPS arrived on the scene to break up the fight, the police were reluctant to accompany the victims back to campus and proceeded to treat them as the antagonists, ” Mhlongo said. Mhlongo said the police should also investigate these allegations as it is unacceptable for the victims of assault to be subjected to further victimisation from the police. -TNA Reporter
