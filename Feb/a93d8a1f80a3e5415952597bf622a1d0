UDM leader Bantu Holomisa has expressed fears that the Finance Minister, Malusi Gigaba, will announce a hike in taxes this week. “I suspect taxes will be raised in order to enable (President) Cyril Ramaphosa’s long list of promises,” Holomisa said. He made the comments on his expectations of the budget on Wednesday and said that this could include increases in personal as well as value added tax. Referring to President Ramaphosa’s promises made when he gave his first state of the nation address (Sona) to a joint sitting of the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces, last Friday night, Holomisa said that what he had tabled needed funding. “One must be worried. It’s a plan that comes from an individual,”Holomisa said. Gigaba delivered his first Medium Term Budget Policy Statement last October in the wake of the sacking of Pravin Gordhan. Gibaba’s MTBPS also came in the wake of R50.8bn shortfall in revenue collection announced by SARS. On Wednesday, it will be another maiden presentation for Gigaba, his first Budget, amid demands from opposition parties that he dropped from the Cabinet. One of the key questions he will have to answer in his Budget is how the government will fund the free higher education announced by then president Zuma during the ANC 54th national conference last December. “The Minister of Finance will clarify all aspects of the financing of the scheme during his budget speech next week,” President Cyril Ramaphosa said in his Sona last Friday. news@thenewage.co.za -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
