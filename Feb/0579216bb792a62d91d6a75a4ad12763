One escaped suspect has been shot and killed while another is recovering in hospital following a shootout with the police. Three trial-awaiting prisoners were being sought after they escaped from the Tubatse police station outside Burgersfort in Limpopo on Monday. One escapee, Simon Mokone, was shot and killed after he allegedly shot at members of the police task team formed to look for the three escapees. Mokone was initially arrested for robbery with aggravating circumstances, illegal possession of a  firearm and possession of suspected stolen property before he escaped. “Upon seeing that he was being cornered by the police, one escapee Simon Mokone, aged 23, allegedly started shooting at the police who retaliated and during that process, he was fatally wounded,” SAPS spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said. The second escapee, Zandile Emmanuel Lebombo, who was arrested for rape, housebreaking, theft and assault is recovering after he was shot in the leg while trying to run away from the police after they found him performing some rituals. Ngoepe said Lebombo would, in addition, face additional charges. “He was treated at a local hospital, discharged and he will appear in he Praktiseer Magistrate’s Court soon on a charge of escaping from lawful custody.” Ngoepe said the police were hoping to arrest the third escapee, Tumelo Vincent Kgoedi, who was arrested for murder and attempted murder. He said authorities were calling on the community to help with information that may lead to his arrest. “Anyone with information can contact Brigadier Lucas Tlhako on 082 565 7584 or Colonel Lazarus Ngele on 082 573 3645. Or they can alternatively call Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211.” He said the police are investigating how the three managed to escape. -TNA Reporter
