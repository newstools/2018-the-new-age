The Gupta-owned Optimum coal mine has been served with court papers by one of many contractors to which it owes millions of rands. Derko Mining & Exploration asked for the company to be placed on business rescue or alternatively be liquidated. This after workers downed tools on Wednesday, seeking an update on the future of the company and payment of their salaries following the announcement by its main banker that it was leaving the country. Last week, Bank of Baroda, which was administering the workers’ salaries, following the closure of the wealthy family’s business accounts, announced that it would be closing its operations in South Africa. The workers said they are concerned about whether they are going to be paid on Friday, given that the company owes many of its service providers millions of rands. Optimum coal mine CEO George van der Merwe said the company had not been paid by Eskom for two months for the coal it had delivered. Van der Merwe said he was in Johannesburg on Wednesday, looking for a bank that would help pay salaries to the workers. He said the company had filed papers asking for the Bank of Baroda to continue paying its salaries, even though it had announced it was exiting South Africa. “If the Bank of Baroda closes its account in South Africa, I will have no option but to close the mine,” van der Merwe said. He said the company was exploring options to protect it and a way forward would be announced later on Thursday. -TNA Reporter
