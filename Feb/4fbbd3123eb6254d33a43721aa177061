The Nelson Mandela Foundation has filed an application to the Equality Court in Johannesburg to declare the old apartheid flag as hate speech, unfair discrimination and harassment based on race. The foundation said the display of the old flag demonstrates the pain experienced by millions of black South Africans who suffered under apartheid. After extensive consultation and reflection following “Black Monday”, the Foundation posed the question: Is it time to criminalize displays of the old flag?. “Through public debates with AfriForum, one of the leading figures in the “Black Monday” demonstrations, it became apparent to the Foundation that some South Africans do not fully appreciate that apartheid was a crime against humanity (as the United Nations declared in 1973), and that gratuitous displays of apartheid symbols, such as the old flag, are a celebration of that crime and a humiliation of its victims,” the foundation said. During these debates, AfriForum conceded that displaying the old flag was “unwise” as it “offends some people”, but argued that it should nevertheless not be “unlawful” as it was a part of history and “you cannot ban history”. The foundation further said it appreciates the importance of history and memory, especially in a country that was still healing from the wounds of the past. “It is sad that the flag is undeniably a part of our history, but that is where it belongs: in museums, documentaries and cathartic creative works. “Gratuitous displays of the old flag – which serve no genuine journalistic, artistic or academic purpose in the public interest – are not about remembering but rather about forgetting our painful pasts.”  -TNA Reporter
