Zimbabwe’s main opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, is critically ill in a South African hospital and his supporters should “brace for the worst”, a party source with knowledge of his condition said on Tuesday. Tsvangirai has been in and out of hospital since disclosing in June 2016 that he had colon cancer. He returned to a Johannesburg hospital for his latest round of treatment in early January. Reuters
