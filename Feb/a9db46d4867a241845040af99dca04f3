The DA has welcomed the resignation of national spokesperson Phumzile van Damme. In a statement on Thursday, the DA’s Federal Council chairperson and member of Parliament (MP), James Selfe, said that the party thanked van Damme for the incredible contribution she had made as national spokesperson over the four years at the helm. “As the longest-serving national spokesperson, she has shown immense dedication in what  is often a demanding job. She has traveled the length and breadth of South Africa delivering the DA message professionally and with passion and grace.” While van Damme resigned as spokesperson she will remain in the party and keep her position as MP. “It is true, I have resigned as DA national spokesperson. I remain a member of the party, an MP and the shadow minister of communications. I love the DA and am committed to building a better future for South Africa with a party I love,” She said on Twitter. The “personal reasons” for her resignation has not been communicated by her or the party. Selfe said van Damme would continue to conduct effective oversight as she has always done. “Refiloe Nt’sekhe will continue as the DA’s national spokesperson, responsible for communicating on issues that crosscut or fall outside the portfolios of our shadow cabinet and will remain the first point of contact for members of the media.” -TNA Reporter
