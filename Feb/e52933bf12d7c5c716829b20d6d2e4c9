President Cyril Ramaphosa has doubled down on the ruling party’s policy towards land redistribution albeit without much of the desired detail. Delivering his maiden State of the Adress (Sona) Ramaphosa doubled down on the ruling party’s resolution taken during its recently held 54th National Conference with regard to accelerating land redistribution. The only indication of how Ramaphosa’s government intends to undergo this task was revealed when he said. “Government will undertake a process of consultation to determine the modalities of the implementation of this resolution.” However, it still remains to be definitively stated by the ruling party about how the momentous task will be implemented. Ramaphosa called on the financial institutions’ sector to become governments partner in providing resources in order to accelerate the land redistribution process. Meanwhile, his 45-minute speech brought to an end a whirlwind week of political uncertainty crowned by a question mark of whether former President Jacob Zuma would indeed step down from his seat. Last week Tuesday National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete had announced the
postponement of Sona in line with a request by Zuma. In an SABC news interview, former President Zuma said he had called for Sona’s postponement to allow for further discussions between himself and the ANC’s top officials regarding his exit from the Union Buildings. Meanwhile, Ramaphosa also upped the ante on the feasibility of free higher education,  training taking on the baton from his predecessor. “The Minister of Higher Education and Training will lead the implementation of this policy, while the Minister of Finance will clarify all aspects of the financing of the scheme during his Budget Speech next week,” said Ramaphosa. The Budget Speech is scheduled for next week Wednesday which it is hoped will provide further fiscal clarity about where the funds will come from. -Siphiwe Mchunu
