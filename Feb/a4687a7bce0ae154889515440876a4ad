Political analyst Lukhona Mguni says he believes that there could be merit to calls by opposition parties to have parliament dissolved. “The fact that the ANC failed to take a decision on whether to recall President Jacob Zuma did not come as a surprise. “It didn’t surprise me that Zuma is refusing to leave office. President Zuma is one of the worst presidents the ANC has ever had to deal with as he prioritize himself before the needs of the country.” Mguni says the president could be clinging onto power because the ANC failed to make a compelling case to convince him to leave office. Meanwhile, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema believes that calls to remove President Zuma by some of the ANC members were driven by factional battles. “The ANC says Zuma must go for factional reasons. That is why you see Derek Hanekom dancing the way he is dancing right now. He is happy that it is their time to eat. It is a factional reason why they want Zuma to go,” Malema said. Malema was addressing the media on Monday at the opposition parties’ plans to have Zuma removed. -Sipho Jack
