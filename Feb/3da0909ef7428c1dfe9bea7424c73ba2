Civil rights group AfriForum on Thursday filed charges of hate speech against the EFF at the Equality Court in the Central Magistrate’s Court in Johannesburg for “shoot to kill the Boer” chants during a protest. This follows a protest outside Hoërskool Overvaal in Vereeniging earlier this year where EFF members are alleged to have chanted the words: “white man, you must die” and “shoot to kill the Boer.” The EFF members were protesting outside the Afrikaans medium school after it refused to accept 55 additional English speaking pupils. “We are convinced that this is hate speech, this is why we are taking this to court and also this has been endorsed by the leadership of the EFF. We are optimistic of this case, we believe that we have a very strong case and that the EFF will eventually be found guilty of hate speech,” AfriForum Deputy CEO Ernst Roets said. In a statement, AfriForum said it directed a letter of demand in this context to the leadership of the EFF but it’s response was unsatisfactory. It claimed that EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi praised the behaviour of the EFF members. AfriForum said that in the state of the serious violence already experienced, hate speech against farmers, in particular, must be stopped. “This is not a philosophical debate. The EFF shouts “kill the farmers” and the farmers are being murdered. This is the hard truth,” Roets said. -TNA Reporter
