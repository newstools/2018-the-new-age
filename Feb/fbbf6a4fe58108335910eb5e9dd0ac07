The Western Cape High Court has extended bail for former provincial police commissioner Arno Lamoer and his co-accused following their conviction on corruption charges on Monday. Lamoer and his three co-accused, former police brigadiers Darius van der Ross, Sharon Govender and Govender’s husband Kolin, as well as tow truck company owner Salim Dawjee, faced 109 charges of corruption, racketeering and money laundering amounting to R1.6 million. Two weeks ago, the four entered into a plea bargain where they all admitted to accepting gratifications from Dawjee in return for favours. They initially pleaded not guilty to the charges of corruption. Lamoer, who had been a police officer for more than 35 years, admitted in court papers that he befriended Dawjee more than 25 years ago when he (Lamoer) was stationed at Manenberg police station. He admitted to “wrongfully” and “unlawfully” accepting a loan from Dawjee for his own benefit. Kolin Govender was found guilty of corruption after he changed his initial not guilty plea. He admitted that he had also received over R20 000 between 2011 and 2013 from Dawjee, who is also his cousin, in return for preferential treatment. Dawjee was found guilty of fraud and corruption while Van der Ross was also found guilty of corruption. Sharon Govender was acquitted on all the charges. All accused were acquitted of racketeering and money laundering. They are expected to appear in court again on 16 April for sentencing.
