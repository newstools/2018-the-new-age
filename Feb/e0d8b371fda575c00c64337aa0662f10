The Black First Land First movement (BLF), in solidarity with the Zonkizizwe community in Ekurhuleni, embarked on a service delivery protest on Monday. “Today we gathered together with the community against service delivery,” the BLF chairperson in Ekurhuleni, Happy Zonke, said. Besides service delivery issues, Zonkizizwe community members were also protesting for government to provide them with shopping malls, schools, adequate transport systems and land expropriation.

He said roads were not safe for them to cross. The protest began in the evening on Sunday and a number of roads in the area were barricaded with stones and rubble.
