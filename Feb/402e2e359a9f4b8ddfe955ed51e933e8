Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba on Wednesday said the 2018 tax proposals are designed to generate an additional R36 billion in tax revenue for 2018-19. During this maiden budget speech in Parliament, Gigaba said, in developing tax proposals, government had reviewed three major potential tax instruments which raise 80% of revenue. “We have increased personal income tax significantly in recent years, particularly at the higher income bands, our corporate tax is high by international standards and we have not adjusted VAT since 1993 and it is low compared to some of our peers.” Gigaba said National Treasury had decided that increasing VAT was unavoidable if the country was to maintain the integrity of the public finances. “In addition to VAT, we are increasing excise duties on luxury goods and estate duty on wealthy individuals.” He said these proposals best protect the progressive nature of the country’s tax regime, to minimise the impact on lower-income households. The main tax proposals for the 2018 budget are: “Today, we update draft VAT regulations to cover foreign businesses selling electronic services to South African consumers.” Working with the Department of Trade and Industry, Gigaba said he had approved six special economic zones that would make qualifying companies subject to a reduced corporate tax rate and enable them to claim an employment tax incentive for workers of all ages. “These measures will promote investment in those manufacturing and tradeable service sectors that encourage exports, job creation and economic growth.” -TNA Reporter
