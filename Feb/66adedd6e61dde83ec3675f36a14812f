Now that the farmers have been restricted day zero is moving back with a month every week, Cosatu said. Following the announcement that day zero has moved back to 6 June, the federation has called on the Human rights Commission, to investigate the manufactured crisis so water could be privatised. Cosatu’s Provincial Secretary Tony Ehrenreich said while climate change is challenging in all areas, the water challenge in Cape Town has been a result of mismanagement. He said the extension of the crisis has been exaggerated for people to be able to sidestep procurement laws and enrich political allies. “An example of this is Tony Leon who received a million rand communication tender and a billion rand desalination plants being explored with dupios suppliers.” Ehrenreich added that farmers were allowed to take half of the daily water used in the City from our dams to speed up the crisis. Cosatu is also calling on the human rights commission to investigate preparations for the day with 200 water points. -TNA Reporter
