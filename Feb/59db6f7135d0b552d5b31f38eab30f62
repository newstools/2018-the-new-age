The DA has accused the speaker of the Free State provincial legislature, Mamiki Qabathe and the Chief Whip, Neels van Rooyen, of deliberately stalling a decision to convene an urgent sitting to debate and vote on a motion of no confidence against Premier Ace Magashule. “We have received correspondence from Speaker Qabathe that she has referred the matter to the chief whip’s committee to consider the process to be followed for a motion of no confidence to be heard. There is currently a lacuna in the legislature’s standing rules and orders with regards to motions of no confidence,” DA provincial leader Roy Jankielsohn said. The DA said it wrote to van Rooyen, urging him to urgently call a meeting of the chief whip’s committee to discuss the procedure to be followed. “We received correspondence from him that due to commitments of the legislature, the next available opportunity to meet to discuss this matter was 26 February, six days after the State of the Province Address scheduled for 20 February in Parys.” Jankielsohn said he would write to Speaker Qabathe and van Rooyen, urging them to immediately consider the request to hold a special sitting to debate and vote on the motion of no confidence in Magashule. “Ace Magashule must be held accountable for the corruption taking place in the Free State provincial government. It is not up to the ANC to simply redeploy him. The legislature has a constitutional duty to hold him accountable. The legislature must do its work by removing the political head of this corrupt patronage network and ensure that implicated individuals face the full might of the law.” –TNA Reporter
