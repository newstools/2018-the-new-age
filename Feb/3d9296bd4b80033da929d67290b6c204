India won the toss and opted to bat in the fourth one-day international against South Africa at the Wanderers Stadium on Saturday as key batsman AB de Villiers returned for the hosts. The South African team were dressed in pink as part of an annual event to raise awareness of breast cancer — a good omen for the hosts who have won on all five previous “Pink Days”. On an overcast day, with a forecast of thundershowers, India captain Virat Kohli said weather conditions were out of his team’s control. “It looks like a hard pitch with grass cover, so the ball should come on to the bat nicely. It is difficult to chase under lights at the Wanderers so we want to take this opportunity to put runs on the board again.” India hold an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the six-match series but Kohli said his team were still looking for ways to improve. South Africa were boosted by De Villiers’ return after he missed the first three matches with a finger injury. In a second change, fast bowler Morne Morkel replaced leg-spinner Imran Tahir, whose only wicket in the first three matches came expensively at a cost of 133 runs, while conceding 5.42 runs an over. Batsman Shreyas Iyer replaced Kedar Jadhav in the first change made by India in four matches. Kohli said it was a forced change because Jadhav had a hamstring injury. South African captain Aiden Markram welcomed the return of De Villiers. “Hopefully there will be some good energy today,” he said.
