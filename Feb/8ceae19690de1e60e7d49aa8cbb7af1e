SA Rugby announced on Wednesday that SuperSport has surrendered its radio broadcast rights fees to the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). This comes after discussions between SA Rugby and SuperSport. The SABC had announced that it would no longer be able to produce live radio broadcasts for Rugby matches. The Public broadcaster said the SABC radio would pull the plug on Super Rugby and the Currie Cup citing financial challenges regarding the radio fees rights. “On behalf of all our rugby followers and SA Rugby, I’d like to thank SuperSport for this significant gesture. “They have worked with us and the SABC to find a solution to keep rugby on the radio airwaves and the waiving of the rights fee to which they are entitled is a significant step in that process,” SA Rugby President Mark Alexander said. The news that live radio could be canned, caught presenters and commentators by surprise. “The fear that rugby commentary might no longer be a feature of our listening experience is a very real and a very worrying one and I’d like to commend SuperSport for the leadership they have shown in this matter. “I trust that the SABC will now be able to reassure listeners that rugby commentary on Vodacom Super Rugby, Currie Cup and Springbok Test matches will be a feature of their 2018 schedules,” SuperSport Chief Executive, Gideon Khobane said. -TNA Reporter
