THE government’s calendar of activities has been thrown into disarray as a result of the impasse over President Jacob Zuma’s future. Phumla Williams, the acting Cabinet spokesperson announced the postponement of today’s scheduled Cabinet meeting, late yesterday afternoon. She said the new date for the meeting would be communicated in due course. “We are alive to the developments taking place in the ruling party. The government reassures South Africans that service delivery will not be impacted upon,” Communications Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane said. Meanwhile, the Gauteng provincial legislature (GPL) has announced the postponement of the state of the province address (Sopa) which was scheduled to take place next Monday. “The GPL would like to inform the people of Gauteng, its stakeholders and members of the media that the 2018 Sopa, has been postponed until further notice,” Fezile Nondonga said. Nondonga did not divulge reasons for the postponement. “The GPL deeply regrets any inconveniences caused and will inform you once a decision has been taken regarding the new date,” he said. However, opposition parties said it was clear that when “national ANC sneezes, the provincial ANC catches the flu”. “It is unfortunate that internal programmes of the ANC are disturbing the functioning of the state. There is nothing we can do, we can’t have Sopa before having Sona,” IFP Gauteng caucus leader Bonginkosi Dhlamini said. This follows the postponement of the state of the nation address which was supposed to have taken place last Thursday due to the impasse over Zuma’s future as the head of the country. National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete said in taking the decision to postpone the Sona, Parliament had taken into account views of political stakeholders, society and concerns about the political environment of the country. -NTOMBI NKOSI|ntombin@thenewage.co.za
