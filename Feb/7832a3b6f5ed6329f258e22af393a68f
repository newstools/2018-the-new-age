Limpopo provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba has praised members of the SAPS for the arrest of two more suspects in connection with the brutal murder of a police officer last week. The older daughter of Warrant Officer Thomas Alugumi Nemugoni, who was stabbed to death at his home, and her accomplice will appear in the Vuwani Magistrate’s Court on Monday after they were arrested on Thursday last week. The 24-year-old accomplice arrested is the older brother of Calvin Tshisudi, another suspect in the case, who appeared in court with the late officer’s 21-year-old daughter Mphophi Nemugumoni last week. Their case has been postponed to 23 February. According to Limpopo police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe, the Tshisudi brothers are known to be notorious criminals in the area. He said the police were still investigating whether the two could be linked to other crimes. Ngoepe said the suspects would face the same charges as those who appeared in court last week. “The suspects will face charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Police investigations are continuing.” -TNA Reporter
