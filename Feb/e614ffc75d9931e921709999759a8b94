The Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has confirmed that Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Des van Rooyen lied to Parliament when he denied visiting the Gupta household days before he was appointed as Finance Minister. The DA said van Rooyen’s conduct was in violation of Executive Ethics Code. The Public Protector has recommended that the President act against Van Rooyen, within 30 days and that the report is tabled in the National Assembly within 14 days of the President receiving the report. “The DA has also recently written to House Chairperson, Cedric Frolick, to implore him to compel the Portfolio Committee for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs to institute a formal enquiry into the extent of State Capture in the Department as repeated requests to the Committee’s Chairperson, Hon. Richard Mdakane, have been routinely ignored,” DA’s Kevin Mileham said. The DA said it will make sure that all allegations of State Capture in CoGTA are thoroughly investigated. -TNA Reporter
