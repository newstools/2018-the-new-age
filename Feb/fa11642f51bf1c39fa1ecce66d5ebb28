The seven suspects arrested in connection with investigations into the Free State Vrede dairy farm project were been granted bail in the Bloemfontein Regional Court on Thursday. The magistrate granted the three state officials accused R10 000 bail each, while accused number 7, 8, 9 and 10 were granted bail R200 000. The prosecution didn’t oppose bail because the accused had already prepared affidavits for bail. The suspects were arrested on Wednesday, when the Hawks raided their homes. At the time the Hawks arrested five people, three of them from Johannesburg, the other two were arrested in Bloemfontein. According to the Hawks, the two other suspects handed themselves over to police on Thursday morning. Earlier in the morning, the Hawks announced that they started serving warrants of arrest on 13 suspects, both from Bloemfontien and Johannesburg, relating to the Vrede farm dairy project. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula directed the acting head of DPCI to make sure that all 10 appeared in court today. The DPCI will soon be naming the two suspects still being sort locally. The Hawks, assisted by the National Intervention Unit of the SAPS, effected the arrests on some of the implicated suspects while others handed themselves over. “I must appreciate the patience of the public in general for allowing law enforcement agencies to do their work. These investigations, naturally, take a lot of time,” Mbalula said. “Due to the sensitivity and seriousness of these matters, it is not possible for the DPCI or my office to provide a minute to minute account of the state of capture-related investigations but once again assure all that since mid-2017 at least 17 dockets are being investigated without fear or favour and indeed with no holy-cows.” -TNA Reporter
