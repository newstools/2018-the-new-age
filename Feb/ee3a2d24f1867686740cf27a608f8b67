The DA in KwaZulu-Natal has called on the Human Settlements MEC Ravi Pillay to place eThekwini’s Housing Department under administration following the announcement that it has missed its own target. The department built 1197 houses for the 2017/2018 financial year instead of a 5299 which was expected. The DA said the department has missed its own target by 4102 units. KwaZulu-Natal Spokesperson on Human Settlements George Mari said the information was revealed during the Department’s 3rd Quarter Report which was presented to members of the provincial portfolio committee on Human Settlements late last week. Mari said they are concerned by this under-performance given that the Metro has the highest housing need in the province with approximately 590 informal settlements. He said the department was able to deliver 10 000 houses per annum ten years ago and the current failure to deliver is a sad indictment of the ANC government. Mari added that during the meeting, the department blamed its overall under-achievement on the Metro. “This blame game is typical of the ANC yet the figures tell us that the ANC-led Human Settlements Department and the Metro housing department have neglected their mandate to deliver basic services to people. “They also tell us the ANC-deployed Mayor is not doing her job properly and raise serious questions about whether the ANC cares about people having a roof over their heads or not.” -TNA Reporter
