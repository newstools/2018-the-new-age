City of Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille has defeated a motion of no confidence against her brought by her own party, the DA. Earlier on Thursday, the city of Cape Town legislature voted on a motion calling for her removal. Two hundred and twenty four council members were able to cast their ballots with 109 voting for de Lille to leave office while 110 voted that she stay. Three abstained and two chose not vote. De Lille took to Twitter, praising the counselors who voted against the motion to remove her. Thank you to the councillors for their support. You showed your courage and conviction. Let’s get back to our work! pic.twitter.com/OWo27Mih43 — Patricia de Lille (@PatriciaDeLille) February 15, 2018 Earlier in the day, de Lille lost her temper when council speaker Dirk Smit decided that the voting on the motion be done through open voting. Smit decided against the voting being done through a secret ballot as the Western Cape High Court ruled in de Lille’s favour on Wednesday that a secret ballot should be one of the speaker’s considerations. De Lille walked out of the assembly and threatened to take Smit’s decision on review, calling it unlawful. -TNA Reporter
