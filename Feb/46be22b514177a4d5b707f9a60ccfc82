The Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) has suspended the Commander Deputy Director Faith Lengwati for alleged insubordination and conducts to put the City in disrepute. This comes after community members complained that the JMPD Kenilworth Satellite Station was not operating as intended and that operating hours were reduced. Public Safety MMC Michael Sun indicated that investigations are underway as the disciplinary hearing process continue. “When we embarked on the Kenilworth Satellite Station project, we wanted JMPD to serve the residents in the area on a 24/7 basis so crime will be reduced, By-laws enforced and the drug dealing be a thing of the past,” Sun said. He added that they are now receiving a number of complaints regarding the poor service at the satellite station. “We will ensure that officials are held to account and deliver the services as we have promised to the people.” -TNA Reporter
