THE department of health will this week host an inaugural Research and Innovation Summit at Birchwood, Ekurhuleni. This is as part of ongoing initiatives and programmes to provide integrated patient centred services. The summit aims to create a learning opportunity that will bring together academia, administrators, students, community representatives, oversight bodies, legislators, health service providers, exhibitors and leaders from across the city region. The overarching objective is to increase awareness about the need to use evidence based research and improve stakeholder participation in the delivery of an effective health system. This is in line with the priorities made by health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa in the budget vote address last year to repurpose and modernise the department. Ramokgopa said: “We have engaged the support of the National eHealth team, the Council for Scientific Industrial Research and the department of eGovernance regarding transformation, modernisation and re-industrialisation. “Already significant progress has been made in reducing waiting times in patient administration, improving availability of medicines, improving communication with pregnant mothers for antenatal and postnatal care as well as in saving costs due to inventory management.” Ramokgopa said building on these successes, an integrated interoperable system would empower patients to understand their health and access to the health system. ntombin@thenewage.co.za -NTOMBI NKOSI
