The South African Football Association (SAFA) announced on Thursday that Banyana Banyana caretaker coach Desiree Ellis has been appointed as permanent head coach. “We are glad to announce the appointment of Desiree (Ellis) as Banyana Banyana coach, she fully deserves the appointment as she has come through all the ranks of our national teams,” SAFA President, Dr Danny Jordaan said. As she takes the reins of the national women’s team, the new coach has been tasked with two major tasks ahead of her, qualify the team for the upcoming AFCON 2018 that is due to be hosted in Ghana. She will also have to qualify for FIFA World Cup and the Olympics tournaments. “I am confident Banyana Banyana will be up to the task,” said Jordaan Ellis has been with Banyana Banyana on an interim basis since 2016 after taking over from the former coach Vera Pauw. She was then serving as the assistant coach to Pauw. Coach Ellis has expressed exhilaration and also thanked South Africans for having supported her. “It still sounds unreal, I honestly can’t believe it is really happening. It has always been a dream of mine to be the head coach of Banyana Banyana; nothing comes bigger than this. Being in the acting role since 2016 has probably prepared me for the most daunting task of them all in women’s football. I have always believed, and now it is a reality,” Ellis said. -TNA Reporter
