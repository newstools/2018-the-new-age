The ANC’s parliamentary caucus spokesperson Nonceba Mhlauli has on Tuesday dismissed reports that ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu is set to table a motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma. This is after social media reports stated that Mthembu will table a motion of no confidence against the president after he refused to resign. However, Mhlauli said the reports are rumours and there is no plan whatsoever by the caucus to table such motion. Meanwhile, ANC’s chief whip has requested a special meeting with the Chief whips forum which is scheduled to take place on Wednesday. “In light of the recent development, the chief whip of the majority party respectfully requests that members attend the meeting of the chief whip’s forum on Wednesday.” On Monday, opposition parties had called for a parliament to be dissolved and fresh elections held before a new president of the country is elected. At the same time, the ANC is expected to brief the media on the outcome of Monday’s National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, which will also share some light on the recall of president Jacob Zuma. -Sipho Jack
