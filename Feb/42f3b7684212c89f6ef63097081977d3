The City of Cape Town has implemented a tarrif increase to force households to use 50 litres of water per day. In line with Level 6 drought measures, the February 2018 water and sanitation accounts of water users will reflect a tariff increase. The residents will have the cost of basic water covered by the municipality, however, residence who use more water will face tariff increase. The executive mayoral office said this is an absolutely necessary step to reducing household demand and to ensure that the City can continue to supply water and sanitation services. “We will still cover the cost of basic water for our indigent residents, but for the rest of our water users these tariff increases are unavoidable. The highest users will face the greatest increases,” executive mayoral office added. -TNA Reporter
