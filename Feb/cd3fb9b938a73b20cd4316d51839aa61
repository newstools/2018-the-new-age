ESKOM head of generations Matshela Koko finally resigned from the power utility last week after months of fighting to save his job. Koko is the fourth senior executive to leave after then Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a new Eskom board led by businessman Jabu Mabusa. Heavyweights such as CFO Anoj Singh, Prish Govender and the utility’s chairperson, Zethembe Khoza, resigned recently over allegations that they were involved in unduly awarding contracts to the Gupta family. Eskom also suspended chief information officer Sean Maritz pending the outcome of an investigation. “The charges against Koko related to grave misconduct. His resignation was only tendered after the disciplinary hearing into these charges had commenced on Friday and Eskom would have preferred to continue with the disciplinary process so that Koko could be held to account for any proven wrongdoing,” Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe, said. Phasiwe said Koko’s resignation during his disciplinary hearing came in the face of serious charges of misconduct for which Eskom would have sought a sanction to summarily dismiss him from the utility. “The board remains committed to its mandate to root out malfeasance,” he said. Eskom’s new board and CEO Phakamani Hadebe gave Koko an ultimatum last month to resign or be fired. He then resorted to the Labour Court and secured an interim order to stop his contract from being cancelled. Eskom insisted that Koko’s attempt to block his dismissal was no longer valid because he had to face an internal hearing based on new charges. This was related to accusations that Koko misled Parliament about payments made to consultancy firm Trillian and that he leaked confidential information to people associated with the Gupta family. -BERNARD SATHEKGE|bernards@thenewage.co.za
