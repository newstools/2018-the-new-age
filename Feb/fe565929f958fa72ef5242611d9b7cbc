The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) has re-introduced the passenger train service travelling between Johannesburg and Musina due to popular demand by commuters. This comes after the service was withdrawn in 2014 due to the rationalisation of train services. The train will also be used by Zimbabwean customers crossing the border after alighting in Musina. Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi and acting PRASA Group CEO, Mr Cromet Molepo officially launch the re-introduced train services at the Johannesburg Park Station.
