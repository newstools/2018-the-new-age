National spokesperson for the Department of Police Vuyo Mhaga on Tuesday said he hoped the conviction of former Western Cape police commissioner Arno Lamoer would show that no one was above the law. Mhanga urged police officers to respect their uniforms and serve the people of South Africa with pride and dignity. “We hope the conviction of Mr Lamoer shows that no one is above the law. Police officers should do their work accordingly and respect their badge,” he said. Mhanga thanked the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) for helping the force to get rid of corrupt officers in the system. Lamoer and two co-accused were found guilty of corruption in the Western Cape High Court on Monday. Prior to Monday’s verdict, the former commissioner and his co-accused pleaded guilty in a plea agreement with the state. This is after Cape Town businessman Saleem Dawjee admitted to paying Lamoer while he was employed by the SAPS in return for favours. Dawjee further admitted that he had given Lamoer and his family more than R60 000 in the period between 2011 and 2013. Meanwhile, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has welcomed the conviction. “This conviction sends a strong message that no one is above the law and it also instills confidence in the country’s criminal justice system that criminals will face the full might of the law,” Mbalula said. “We need police who must understand that their job is a calling as they have a duty to serve and protect the people.” -TNA Reporter
