Global non-profit AIDS organisation, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) will on Tuesday celebrate International Condom Day (ICD) day before the world celebrates Valentine’s Day. ICD is a day where the public, in general, is reminded about the importance of using a condom, the correct way and the benefits of using a condom. The organisation which operates in 39 countries with more than 860,000 patients in care, aims at spreading awareness especially with Valentine’s Day coming. Hilary Thulare Country Programme Director, AHF South Africa said, “Our key message remains that condoms are ‘Always in Fashion’, regardless of how long you have been with and how well you think you know your intimate partner, condom use is critical”. Thulare added that the use of condoms does not only prevent the chances of pregnancy but also prevents sexually transmitted infections (STI’s), HIV/AIDS along with reducing the risk of cervical cancer and wart-causing human papillomavirus (HPV) in women. In a recent campaign which was launched by the government, it indicated that the youth between the ages of 18-24 years old are having unprotected sex occasionally and that condoms have been seen as ‘uncool’ thing would limit them from the sexual sensations of intercourse. During last year’s AHF engagement, shocking methods used by young people in lubricating the condom during sex some stated that they used their own spit whilst others said that they to Vaseline, Baby Oil, Cooking Oil etc. The organisation will also host several activations and events around South Africa, distributing condoms, educating the public on proper condom usage and conducting HIV/AIDS testing at Fort Hare University in Eastern Cape, Diepsloot in Gauteng and Umlazi’s Mega City in KwaZulu-Natal. -TNA Reporter
