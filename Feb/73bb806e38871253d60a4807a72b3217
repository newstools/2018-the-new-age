The Special Investigative Unit (SIU) has announced during the Parliament’s Communications Committee on Tuesday that former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng owes the public broadcaster more than R21 million. “Today in Parliament’s Communications Committee, the SIU confirmed that the R21 million includes an R11.4 million ‘success fee’ Motsoeneng received for the so-called MultiChoice ‘archives deal’ and an additional R10.5 million in damages related to the irregular appointment and dismissal of staff,” DA’s Shadow Minister of Communications Phumzile Van Damme said. The investigative unit has also taken action to recover the alleged millions that  Motsoeneng owes to the SABC. “The Special Investigative Unit (SIU) has today confirmed that it has issued a summons against the disgraced former SABC COO, Hlaudi Motsoeneng, for more than R21 million he owes the SABC,” she said. Meanwhile, the SIU is also investigating eight other contracts that have been identified as ‘dodgy’ during the SABC Ad Hoc inquiry. This includes the R460 million contract with MultiChoice that had previously been reported. In 2016 the high court ruled that  Motsoeneng’s appointment as Group Executive was illegal. The former SABC COO is currently challenging his SABC dismissal at the CCMA where he was fired after he was found guilty of contravening the corporation’s code of conduct. The DA says that it is waiting to receive the final findings from the SIU to further scrutinize for all those implicated. “The SIU plans to hand over the Interim Presidential Report on their investigations into these dodgy contracts to the Office of the President on 31 May 2018.” -TNA Reporter
