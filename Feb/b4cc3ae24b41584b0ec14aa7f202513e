The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) has reiterated its call for a comprehensive intervention plan following the torching of yet another school in Vuwani. Shondoni Secondary School in the Lwamondo village was allegedly set alight in the early hours of Friday morning after thieves forced open burglar doors of the administration building and proceeded to set the building alight, causing damage estimated at R1.2 million. Preliminary police investigations revealed that several items including four computers, a safe, steel cabinet and printers were stolen. Sanco spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu has urged the community to assist police to get those involved arrested. “It is treacherous that destruction of public infrastructure investments in the area continues to reverse development aimed at bridging the urban-rural divide and the provision of quality public education,” Mahlangu said. Mahlangu said the senseless destruction of property would deepen poverty, unemployment and inequality in the region. He said there was now an urgent need for the deployment of security personnel to protect public infrastructure in Vuwani. -TNA Reporter
