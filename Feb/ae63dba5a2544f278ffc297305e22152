President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to deliver the keynote address at an interfaith service aimed at remembering soldiers who died in the line of duty, and those who are deployed in several countries on peacekeeping missions. The prayer service will be held in Kimberley in preparation of Armed Forces Day on Wednesday, 21 February. This is Ramaphosa’s first public engagement as the country’s commander in chief and the first since his election as president last week following the resignation of former President Jacob Zuma. Armed Forces Day commemorates the sinking of the SS Mendi in the English Channel on that day in 1917 during the first World War. It is reported that the boat was carrying over 800 servicemen, many of whom were black South Africans on their way to take part in the first World War when the SS Mendi was struck by another larger South African vessel, SS Darro, which led to its sinking on the morning of 21 February 1917. The South African National Defence Force will also use the event to showcase a number of opportunities that can be pursued by young people in the army. -TNA Reporter
