Former KwaZulu-Natal economic development MEC Mike Mabuyakhulu has been granted R50 000 bail by the Durban Commercial Crimes Court for charges of alleged corruption amounting to R28 million. Mabuyakhulu, who was recently appointed as the ANC provincial task team head, appeared in court to face allegations of defrauding the KZN provincial government of R28m that was paid for a music festival, which never took place. He pleaded not guilty to all charges and during proceedings, on Wednesday, his legal representative argued that he could only afford R30 000 bail. However, the court set his request aside. #MikeMabuyakhulu arrives at the Durban Commercial Crimes Court for charges of fraud and corruption @ANN7tv pic.twitter.com/tSszqm3R76 â€” Phathisa Mfuyo (@thisamfuyo) February 7, 2018 According to his bail conditions, the former MEC, alongside his co-accused, must always appear on the set court dates and the R50 000 bail must be paid in cash. The accused were also directed to hand over their passports and are not allowed to leave KZN or the country without notifying the court. The court case is set to resume on 16 April. According to court papers, the North Sea Jazz Festival was meant to be hosted in the province between 2012 and 2013. However, despite the event being canceled, millions were reportedly transferred to a company known as Soft Skills Trading which allegedly then paid over money to Mabuyakhulu and his co-accused. The co-accused include well known KZN businessmen Ceaser Walter Mkhize and Mabheleni Ntuli. -TNA Reporter
