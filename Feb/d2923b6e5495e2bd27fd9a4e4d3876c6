Portfolio Committee Chairperson of Mineral Resources, Sahlulele Luzipo has welcomed President Cyril Ramaphosa’s commitment in making sure mining companies play its role in growing mining sector. “The intervention by the president would be welcome after the committee had been concern about recent accidents that occurred in the past months.” Luzipo said this will makes sure that accidents in mines will be reduced significantly. “During its week-long oversight visit to Gauteng from the 29th January to 2nd February 2018, the Committee has discovered that it was possible for the mining accidents to be reduced significantly. “The Department of Mining Engineering at the University of Pretoria, Council for Science and Industrial Research (CSIR) mining dust research facility as well as mining hub and, the Department of Mining at the University of the Witwatersrand have illustrated the fact that research was key to mining safety.” He said Friday’s announcement by President was in line with the commitment he made at the Chamber of Mines, in which he promised to undertake the facilitation of engagements between the Chamber, Department of Mineral Resources, labour and other stakeholders in order to finalise a mutually agreed Charter. “Having led the processing of the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) Amendment Bill which was adopted by the National Assembly, Mr Luzipo was encouraged by the fact that President Ramaphosa is looking forward to enacting the Bill into law in order to entrench existing regulatory certainty within the mining sector.” -TNA Reporter
