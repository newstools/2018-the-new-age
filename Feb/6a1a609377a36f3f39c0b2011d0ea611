The Overvaal Transformation Committee (OTC) has criticised the provincial department of education for paying lip service to the issue of transformation and not making sure that it happens in earnest. Chairperson of the committee Tloriso Mofokeng said since they protested outside the school last month, at the beginning of the 2018 academic year, the department has not taken any tangible action to show that it is serious about the transformation of the school. Mofokeng was speaking outside the school where members of the committee held a picket where they showed their unhappiness with the school’s pace of transformation. Hoërskool Overvaal recently won a court application that overturned the department’s decision to admit 55 more students for the 2018 academic year. Mofokeng said primary schools in the area have been transforming for the past 15 years and they are concerned where all those students are going to study when they are done with their primary schooling as there are very few schools in the area. “At the time that the department was allowing English to be used at former Afrikaans only schools, they should have also made sure that they make this school open for those who were going to be studying in English,” Mofokeng said. Mofokeng called on President Cyril Ramaphosa not to reappoint Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga, as she does not take the interests of education, especially those of students in the area seriously. “She does not know what is expected of her as a national minister. She has dismally failed the country and she has failed in her career. Motshekga has been a minister of education for 10 years she did nothing about this and prior to that she was MEC of education here in Gauteng, she did not address this issue.” -TNA Reporter
