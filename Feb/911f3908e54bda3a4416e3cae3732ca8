The ANC has appointed national executive committee (NEC) member and former Police Minister Fikile Mbalula to be its Head of Elections at Luthuli House with immediate effect. Mbalula was recently shafted and replaced with Bheki Cele in President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Cabinet reshuffle on Monday night. According to ANC Deputy Secretary-General Jesse Duarte, Mbalula’s appointment is in line with the special NEC meeting on Sunday, to deploy several chairpersons of committees to Luthuli House. Duarte said Mbalula had served the movement with utmost determination and commitment for many years, as both the Secretary-General and President of the ANC Youth League for almost a decade. “He has also served as a member of Cabinet for over a decade, recently serving as a Minister of Police.” She said the ANC was confident of Mbalula’s leadership at the helm of the party’s elections machinery as the party advances towards a landslide victory in the 2019 National Elections. -TNA Reporter
