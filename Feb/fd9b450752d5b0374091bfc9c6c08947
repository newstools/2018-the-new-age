The charred remains suspected to be that of missing police officer Const Senzeni Msipha has led to the arrest of her boyfriend and one other suspect. The remains were found in a burnt out vehicle in rural Inyoni last Thursday and were identified by her family as that of the 33-year-old police officer. Intense investigations since her disappearance eventually led to the arrest of two suspects, aged 32 and 35. The suspects cannot be named until they have been charged. Police spokesperson Lt-Col Thulani Zwane confirmed the suspects appeared at the Nyoni Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. “They were remanded in custody until February 21 for a bail application,” Zwane said. However the body has not yet been officially identified as that of Msipha. “We are still waiting for DNA results,” Zwane said. Msipha was last seen on the morning of January 31 when she left her home in Maqhakaza, near Gingindlovu, to go shopping at the local mall. She never returned home. She was reported missing by her family which led to a nationwide search headed by the Gingindlovu police. Police said at the time of her disappearance she was wearing a blue T-shirt and black sandals and driving her blue Ford Fiesta bearing the registration number NRB 66869. Both suspects will reappear in court on Wednesday. In a separate incident, the search for Ntombifikile Junerose Dube, 51, from Umbumbulu area, is still on.
