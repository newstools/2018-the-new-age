LEGENDARY American DJ Louie Vega has congratulated local DJ Black Coffee for his upcoming Apollo Theatre date at the weekend. The Pieces Of Me hit maker will take on one of the world’s toughest crowds at the famous Apollo Theatre in New York as part of the Africa Now event on Saturday, alongside the legendary Nigerian-born Paris-based drummer, Tony Allen, and American techno pioneer Jeff Mills to name just a few. The Apollo billing comes just days after the Durban born vinyl spinner was nominated for favourite global music star for the upcoming Nickelodeon 2018 Kids’ Choice Awards. On Instagram Vega said: “Proud of my brother Black Coffee Nkosinathi Maphumulo, he will be performing at the Apollo next week with my Detroit brother Jeff Mills! This is history right here. We will be there my brother enjoying and smiling. No limits to where our music can reach. Keep on rising.” True to its famous slogan, Where Stars are Born and Legends are Made, the Apollo Theatre is one of New York’s most historic theatres, which turned into the mecca of black show business, becoming noted for launching the careers of African American mega stars Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Dionne Warwick, James Brown, Jimi Hendrix and the Jackson Five among others. Established in 1914 under the name Hurtig & Seamon’s New Burlesque Theatre, it was renamed the Apollo in 1934. siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
