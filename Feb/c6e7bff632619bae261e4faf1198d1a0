A Bangkok court on Tuesday granted a Japanese man “sole parent” rights to 13 babies fathered through Thai surrogate mothers, a ruling that paves the way for him to take custody of the children. “For the happiness and opportunities of the 13 children… the court rules that all who were born from surrogacy to be legal children of the plaintiff,” Bangkok’s Central Juvenile Court said in a statement. Mitsutoki Shigeta was deemed the “sole parent” of the children and had prepared nurses and nannies to help care for them in Japan, the court added. -AFP
