PROTEAS fast bowler Kagiso Rabada was found guilty of breaching the ICC player’s conduct during the fifth ODI against India in Port Elizabeth. Rabada was fined 15% of his match fee and received one demerit point after a Level 1 breach of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel. He now has five demerit points on his disciplinary record after he received three against Sri Lanka in an ODI match and one in the Lord’s Test against England, both last year. This follows Rabada’s reaction where he waved and made a provocative comment towards India’s Shikhar Dhawan after the South African bowler had dismissed the batsman. He was charged by the on-field umpires Ian Gould and Shaun George‚ third umpire Aleem Dar and fourth umpire Bongani Jele under article 2.1.7 which relates to “using language‚ actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batsman upon his/her dismissal during an international match”. Rabada was suspended from the Trent Bridge Test against England after his demerit points reached four following the Lord’s breach. If Rabada reaches the next threshold of eight or more demerit points within a 24-month period, he will be suspended again from either two Tests, one Test and two ODIs/T20Is, or four ODIs/T20Is, whichever comes first. nevillek@thenewage.co.za
