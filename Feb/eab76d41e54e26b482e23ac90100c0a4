The EFF has called on Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to step down from her post following a damning verdict delivered by the North Gauteng High Court on Friday. The court ordered that Mkhwebane personally pay 15% of Absa and the South African Reserve Bank’s (Sarb) legal bills after setting aside her Bankorp/CIEX report in which she ordered that Absa pay R1.25 billion for the apartheid-era bailout of Absa’s predecessor Bankorp. The EFF said the court openly said it was clear that Mkhwebane did not fully understand her constitutional duty to be impartial after she disclosed that she had had a meeting with former President Jacob Zuma and State Security during her investigations. EFF Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said, if this important office is to have integrity, it cannot be occupied by people who lie or are misleading. Ndlozi said the judgment means that the Public Protector has failed in her duties as a public protector, hence the party’s call for her to step down with immediate effect. “Failure by Mkhwebane to step down, the EFF will initiate a parliamentary process in terms of section 194 of the Constitution,” Ndlozi said. -TNA Reporter
