The DA has risked people’s lives and jobs to keep providing water to farmers in the Western Cape, Cosatu has said. In a statement on Tuesday, Cosatu expressed it’s dissatisfaction about the water crisis in the city of Cape Town, saying it showed a stunning level of incompetence. Provincial spokesperson Tony Ehrenreich said the city and province should know how much water is available and who it is going to. If calculations reveal that half of the water available in a dam is going to farmers, Cosatu said it must be stopped, before creating panic among residents. “Surely farmers’ plants must be allowed to die before people do, however, to DA black people’s lives are less important than farmers’ profit,” Ehrenreich said. He said farmers had used their quota of water from National Movement and must be stopped from taking any more water from the dams. Cosatu has urged the city to cut the amount of water given to farmers, to provide for human and livestock consumption but said the DA leaders had refused to cut water to farmers. Cosatu will be meeting with the business sector in Cape Town on 8 February to discuss urgent measures that should be taken to avoid day zero. -TNA Reporter
