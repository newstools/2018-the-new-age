The case against 29-year-old Cebolenkosi Gift Philani Ntuli, who was arrested in connection with the murder of Siam Lee in KwaZulu-Natal, has been postponed to 9 February for further investigation. Ntuli made a brief appearance in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Friday. He was arrested at his home in Hillcrest last month after an intensive investigation by the police. Lee, 20, was reported missing at the Durban North police station on 4 January. Her burnt body was found a few days later, in a sugarcane field in New Hanover. Ntuli, who represented himself, told the court of alleged torture and harassment he had been getting at the police station and requested that the court move him to Westville prison. Ntuli said he had been suffocated with plastic and had bruises all over his body. He said he feared for his life. Friends and family members of the deceased who were present in court voiced their anger after proceedings were postponed, saying Ntuli was complaining about sleeping on a mat for two weeks whereas Siam Lee is dead. The 20-year-old’s mother, who was also in court, refused to speak to the media. -TNA Reporter
