AfriForum on Wednesday wrote a letter to the African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC), raising concern over an increase in listeriosis deaths. Since Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi announced the outbreak, the death toll has increased rapidly, from 36 in December to almost 200 in February. The number of confirmed laboratory cases now stands at almost 1 000. “The state has shown little progress in finding the cause, or preventing deaths. The government seems unable to manage the crisis efficiently,” AfrForum strategic advisor for community services Dr Eugene Brink said. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), this is the worst listeriosis outbreak in world history. “Currently, AfriForum is compiling a comprehensive report which will study the problem, source, transmission and situation of this outbreak in South Africa and the rest of the world.” Brink said report would also contain advice to help protect vulnerable people. Head of environmental affairs at AfriForum, Marcus Pawson said: “We will meet with chain stores to plan measures to curb this problem together. The minister’s office has not yet provided answers to AfriForum’s questions. As part of our watchdog function, we will continue to pressurise government and other food role players.” -TNA Reporter
