Orlando Pirates newly signed striker Augustine Mulenga looks to miss out the game against Chippa United on Saturday at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. The 27 year old injured his knee at training and is expected to be out of action for at least two weeks. The Zambian international is also expecting to get his work permit later this week. According to the Bucs medical staff, Mulenga strained his knee after attempting to shoot whilst in an awkward position. Meanwhile, Diamond Thopola remains doubtful to make the 18-man squad that will travel to his former employers the Chilly Boys. The full back is still nursing a quad strain injury he suffered in Piratesâ€™ 2-0 win over Ajax Cape Town. -TNA Reporter
