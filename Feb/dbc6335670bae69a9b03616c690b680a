A police officer’s daughter and another suspect have been arrested for the murder of a Limpopo police officer who was killed on Monday. Warrant Officer Thomas Alugumi Nemugumoni, who was working at Levubu Police Station,  from the Tshakuma Luvhalani B village outside Thohoyandou, was stabbed at his home on Monday. Police said officials first arrested a 19-year-old suspect following an intensive investigation by the Thohoyandou Cluster Task Team, Detective Service and Crime Prevention. Police Spokesperson Motlafela Mojapelo said investigations then led the police to the deceased’s 21-year-old daughter who is believed to be the mastermind behind the officer’s killing. “The motive for the officer’s killing is not known. Police are busy with their investigations,” Mojapelo said. The two suspects will appear in Vuwani Magistrate’s Court on Friday. Mojapelo said police could not rule out the possibility of more suspects being arrested. -TNA Reporter
