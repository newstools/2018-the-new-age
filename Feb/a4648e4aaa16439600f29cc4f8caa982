The Automobile Association (AA) on Friday said fuel prices are likely to drop again at the end of February. The AA was commenting on un-audited mid-month fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund. The petrol price is expected to decline by 28 cents per litre while diesel is expected to decline by 36 cents and 21 cents for illuminating paraffin. “International oil prices have been declining steeply since the start of February and this factor has accounted for approximately half of the petrol price reduction and more than two-thirds of the diesel price reduction,” the AA said. The AA indicated that the resignation of Jacob Zuma as president of South Africa caused some strengthening in the rand and that it expects an additional impact on the fuel price before month-end. “The country is also on notice for a further credit rating downgrade, which might be triggered after next week’s Budget – if the numbers come in behind expectations. We advise motorists to be extremely prudent and not bank on ongoing fuel price declines in the medium term.” -TNA Reporter
