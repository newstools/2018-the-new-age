ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu on Thursday confirmed that the postponed State of the Nation Address (Sona) would be delivered on Friday evening. Following Jacob Zuma’s resignation, Parliament announced that it had changed its Thursday afternoon programme in order to elect a new president. This will give space for the Sona to be held on Friday evening at 7pm after the new president is sworn in. “After this activity, today of the election of the new president, the next programme of Parliament will then be the State of the Nation Address by the new president tomorrow (Friday) evening at 7pm. That is in our programme.” “What will then not happen in terms of what is in our programme is the sitting tomorrow morning that was meant to elect the new president because that election will take place today in the National Assembly,” Mthembu said. The Sona was postponed last week. -TNA Reporter
