Makeup artist and cosmetics entrepreneur has unveiled her latest new beauty launch, and it is all about the shimmer. The creative shared the news with her 1.7 million Instagram followers over the weekend, when she uploaded a clip of the new product in action at London Fashion Week. Dubbed “Hollywood Flawless Filter,” the new drop consists of a complexion booster that also acts as a highlighter and primer. Responsible for the ultra-dewy skin sported by the models at Alice Temperley’s Autumn/Winter 2018 fashion show over the weekend, it can be dabbed onto the bridge of the nose or the cheekbones, either over or under foundation. According to charlottetilbury.com, where it is set to launch on February 22, the filter aims to “smooth fine lines & pores, blur imperfections & give a super starlit glow.” The news is the latest milestone in Tilbury’s rapidly growing beauty empire, which was launched in 2013 on the premise of making makeup accessible via set looks and video tutorials. Her extensive range has since grown to encompass makeup, skincare and fragrance and is stocked globally, with the creative launching her first ever US pop-up store in LA at the end of last year. -Relaxnews
