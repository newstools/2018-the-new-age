The police have launched a manhunt for five inmates who escaped from custody when the vehicle they were travelling in was attacked on the Golden Highway in Johannesburg on Sunday. Provincial SAPS spokesperson Lungelo Dlamini confirmed that the five escapees were all awaiting trail and had been charged with murder. Two are from central Johannesburg and three are from Dobsonville. Dlamini said the suspects, who were travelling in a silver BMW, shot at the truck carrying the inmates with a rifle until it lost control and managed to cut a piece from the side of the truck. Dlamini said: “The driver was wounded in the leg and he has been taken to hospital for treatment.” The suspects are still at large. -TNA Reporter
