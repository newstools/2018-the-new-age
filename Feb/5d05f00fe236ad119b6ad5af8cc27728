The city of Tshwane on Thursday extended its heartfelt condolences following the death of a traffic officer killed in the line of duty. It’s understood the officer was gunned down during a robbery at a food outlet in the Lyttelton area on Wednesday night. The spokesperson to the executive mayor of Tshwane, Samkelo Mgobozi said: “It is reported that the officer walked by in one of the food outlets while an armed robbery was taking place. He was shot and killed instantly. The suspects sped off with an undisclosed amount of money.” In recent weeks, the traffic fraternity has suffered great losses after two JMPD traffic officers were knocked down by an alleged drunk driver while conducting a roadblock in Johannesburg. Members of the public have been urged to come forward with any information regarding the incident. -TNA Reporter
