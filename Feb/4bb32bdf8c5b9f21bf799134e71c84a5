Outgoing Free State Premier and ANC Chairperson Ace Magashule will on Tuesday table what is expected to be his last State of the Province Address (Sopa). Magashule is expected to relinquish both his premiership and the ANC chairmanship following his election as ANC Secretary-General during the December elective conference. The DA in the province has approached the courts asking that Free State legislature Mamiki Qabathe be compelled to table a motion of no confidence against Magashule. The Sopa will take place at the Afridome in Parys on Tuesday evening after it was postponed as a result of the recalling of former President Jacob Zuma and the election of his successor, Cyril Ramaphosa. The Sopa comes in the midst of a corruption scandal involving the Estina Dairy Farm project in the province. It is alleged that millions of rands were channelled from the dairy project to several Gupta-linked individuals and businesses. Magashule is expected to give a provincial perspective on several policy announcements that were taken by the ANC during its December elective conference. Magashule is expected to speak a lot about the ruling party’s announcement of a policy of expropriation of land without compensation. He is also expected to speak about his controversial pet project Operation Hlasela which he established in 2009 to speed up service delivery. The initiative has been criticised and called a project to channel money to Magashule and his connected ANC elite. He is also expected to speak about initiatives that are going to be introduced by the provincial government to create jobs in the province as Ramaphosa announced during his State of the Nation Address that job creation among young people was a priority. -TNA Reporter
