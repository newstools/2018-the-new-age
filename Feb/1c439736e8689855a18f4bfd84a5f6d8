President Donald Trumpâ€™s personal lawyer said Tuesday he paid $130,000 of his own money to a porn star who once said she had an affair with Trump. The attorney, Donald Cohen, said in a statement to the New York Times that he was not reimbursed for the payment to the actress, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford and goes by Stormy Daniels. Cohen insisted the payment was legal and declined to give details such as why he made the payment, the Times said. -AFP
