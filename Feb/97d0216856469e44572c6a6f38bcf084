The EFF has written a letter to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to demand that an upcoming motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma be conducted through a secret ballot. The motion of no confidence against Zuma has been scheduled for 22 February. In the letter, the EFF demands that Mbete exercise the powers placed upon her “by section 102 of the Constitution that determine that the voting procedure take place by way of a secret ballot, based on the grounds contained in a letter by the chief whip of the EFF, dated July 14 2017, which are still prevalent and relevant today.” The EFF has pointed, among others, to the formal complaint to law enforcement and threats associated with the previous motion as grounds for a secret ballot. “The intimidation by Zuma, [who] told members of the National Assembly that he preferred that the situation, which obtained before the judgment, that the voting be done by open vote, should be retained. This is the worst form of intimidation of members of Parliament and it borders on blatant contempt of court.” reads the letter. The party said the Constitutional Court clearly said members of Parliament needed to be protected from the dangers of “undue influence, intimidation or fear of disapproval by others.” The EFF also expressed its disapproval at a decision to schedule the motion of no confidence against Zuma after the State of the Nation Address (Sona). “We want to place it on record that as the EFF, your decision to schedule a motion of no confidence. not as per our request for it to be scheduled before the Sona, is not acceptable and fails to comprehend the important and urgent matter of removal of Mr Zuma from the office of the Presidency.” -TNA Reporter
