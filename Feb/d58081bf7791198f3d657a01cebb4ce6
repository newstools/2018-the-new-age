PUBLIC protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, who has a Valentine Day’s date with Parliament’s justice committee over her report on the Vrede dairy farm, will also find her report subjected to a review. The DA said at a media briefing in Cape Town yesterday it was taking the report on judicial review. DA leader Mmusi Maimane slammed the report released last week as “disgraceful”. “There are manifold omissions in the report and failures to investigate even that which is in the public domain,” he said. There was no effort shown to hold those responsible accountable, Maimane said. “Free State Premier Ace Magashule and Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane get off unscathed, along with the Guptas,” he said. “We were the original complainants in the Vrede matter. We had expected some form of real justice for them, but this report has bitterly disappointed us … we must correct this,” Maimane said. After consultation with its legal team, the DA has decided to take the public protector’s report on judicial review. “Our lawyers are drafting papers and we hope to launch this application later this week. Further details of such will be communicated in due course.” Meanwhile, Parliament’s justice and correctional services portfolio committee has said it is extremely concerned about statements made by the public protector. “We have further noted with grave concern allegations of her office suppressing some evidence,” committee chairperson Mathole Motshekga said. Mkhwebane has been asked to address the committee tomorrow. news@thenewage.co.za -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
