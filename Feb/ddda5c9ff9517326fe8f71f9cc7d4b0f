AMERICAN hip hop producer Swizz Beatz has without doubt fallen in love with Mzansi, its people and colourful cultural expressions. This was evident at the weekend when the awardwinning beat maker took to the streets of Johannesburg to go shopping alongside friend Black Coffee and then also attended rapper Da Les’ All White Party and mingled with the likes of DJ Fresh and rapper Reason. Besides being taken by Maxhosa Ladumo’s colourful garments after he made a stop at his Maboneng store and purchased a few items, Swiss Beatz, who is married to R&B sensation Alicia Keys, revealed he had added two Esther Mahlangu rugs to his art collection. “I’m the happiest guy in the world rite now because I just added two amazing #esthermahlangu works to the Dean Collection. This lady is the Queen!!! Thx @ realblackcoffee for the plug. Ndebele Love,” he wrote on Instagram. The Money In The Bank hitmaker described the country as his second home. “This trip was very special to me wow. Thank you South Africa for making me feel home every single day, blessings and love,” he said.
