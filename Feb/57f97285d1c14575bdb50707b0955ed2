Parliament’s portfolio committee on communications on Wednesday announced it will be instituting a process to remove Icasa Chairperson Rubben Mohlaloga as both a member and chairperson of the organisation. Mohlaloga, who was appointed in December, was found guilty of fraud and money laundering in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria last month. The court found that Mohlaloga, acting with three co-accused, defrauded Land Bank of about R6 million by transferring money from the bank to an attorney’s trust account. Committee chairperson Humphrey Maxegwana said the committee would remove Mohlaloga from his position following his conviction. Maxegwana said the committee would inform Mohlaloga of its decision and give him an opportunity to explain why he should not be removed. “The process will be done in line with Section 8 of the Icasa Act,” Maxegwana said. The three will be sentenced in April. Mohlaloga is a former deputy president of the ANC Youth League and previously served as an ANC member of Parliament. He previously served as acting chairperson of the Icasa board since 2016 – prior to his appointment in December. -TNA Reporter
