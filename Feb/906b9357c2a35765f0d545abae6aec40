MMUSI Maimane has appealed to ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa to go beyond their party differences and work together in the interest of South Africa. In delivering what he called his “alternative state of the nation address” in Alexandra yesterday, the DA leader congratulated Ramaphosa on his election as ANC president. “I hope this marks the start of an era of cooperation and partnership between our parties. Now, more than ever, we need to set aside our differences. We cannot allow petty politics and pointscoring to threaten the safety and wellbeing of the people,” he said. The only way to defeat the crippling drought in the Western and Eastern Cape “is if we work together, with no hidden agendas, across all levels of government. Millions of South Africans are counting on us,” he said. Maimane said the people of these provinces were entitled to the best service that could be provided. “I’m asking you to do what is right in this crisis situation. “Beyond the drought, we want to engage in a constructive way with the government’s plan for our country.” But to do this the DA needed to know what plan would be put forward. “Which Sona will be presented in Parliament, Cyril Ramaphosa’s or Jacob Zuma’s? And if it’s Zuma’s, then what is the point? “Why are we wasting our time? South Africa needs a new beginning. We don’t need false hope and empty promises.” Many people looked at the ANC that Ramaphosa has inherited and at the corrupt people elected around him. They were saying little has changed. It was the same organisation with a different head. Maimane said. “Fellow South Africans, this new beginning exists. Many of my colleagues have been working tirelessly at putting together a plan to set our country on a new road. It is a plan with an obsessive focus on bringing millions of excluded South Africans into work. To make them part of the country many other South Africans take for granted.” news@thenewage.co.za -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
