The DA has warned that Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini will once again jeopardise the livelihood of millions of grant recipients unless National Treasury takes over. “It is clear that we are fast-approaching another social grants standoff with Minister Dlamini, the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) and Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) on one side and 17 million poor and vulnerable South Africans on the other,” the DA said in a statement. The party said it supports a report submitted to the Constitutional Court this week by a panel of experts appointed to oversee Sassa’s readiness to take over the distribution of social grants. “In its report, the panel has recommended that the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation investigate the desirability of National Treasury taking over the payment of social grants as well as the feasibility of Sassa or the Department of Social Development taking over the functions of administration, registration and verification.” The DA said it had previously called on Treasury to take over the payment function from Sassa “as the agency has become compromised under the toxic influence of Dlamini.” The party has accused Sassa and Dlamini of dragging their feet in finding an alternative service provider and lacking a clear plan of action. Meanwhile, Dlamini has recently been accused of having orchestrated the crisis at Sassa. Former Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza last week told a commission of inquiry into the grants debacle that the minister’s aim “was to frustrate things at Sassa leading up to the deadline.” Magwaza said: “The expertise were already there when the work streams came in but they didn’t contribute anything, they instead pushed for CPS.” -TNA Reporter
