The DA says it is disappointed following Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s 2018 budget speech, adding that the increase in taxes revealed an ANC government which had failed to plan ahead. DA deputy shadow minister of finance and member of Parliament Alf Lees said Gigaba’s budget hammered on the poor and was the legacy of former President Jacob Zuma’s disastrous management of the economy. “The announcements made today are nothing less than a massive body blow to poor South Africans. They will dampen economic growth and fail to create much-needed jobs,” Lees said. He said the VAT increase of 1% was a smack in the face for the millions of South Africans who faced a daily battle to put food on the table. “This increase, combined with the new fuel levy increase, will force poor South Africans to pay more for basic goods, services and transport.” Lees said that instead of taking decisive action to cut wasteful expenditure, Gigaba introduced proposals for cost-cutting that would only reduce service delivery. While the allocation of R57 billion to fund poor students in higher education seems like a step in the right direction, Lees said it failed to address the true nature of the problem and the decades of chronic under-funding in the sector. “All in all, the minister has failed to cut the fat and has opted instead to protect the few and reach into the pockets of poor South Africans to cover the cost. -TNA Reporter
