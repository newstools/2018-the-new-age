The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) says it is disappointment with Eskom for congratulating its managers in the Free State Province for restoring electricity at the Beatrix Mine last week Friday. This comes after 955 mineworkers were trapped underground at the Beatrix Mine due to a heavy storm which prevented the evening shift workers from exiting the mine. The storm affected an elevator used to bring the workers to ground. Eskom had to intervene and help bring the workers to the surface. “We are really disappointed because it was our members at the lower level who worked hard day and night to restore electricity at the Beatrix Mine last week,” UM Free State Deputy Regional Secretary Isaac Mtshotwana said. “It shows that Eskom doesn’t care about the lower level employees. They care about the managers who did nothing to restore electricity. Beatrix Mine is back to normal because of our members,” he added. The workers were brought to surface unharmed on Friday. However, Amcu President, Joseph Mathunjwa on Friday told workers to return to work when the mine is complying with safety regulations.
