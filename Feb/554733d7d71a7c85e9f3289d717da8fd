EFF national spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi says the country’s law enforcement agencies only acted on some matters after the recent political change in the country, which is a sign of undue influence. This comes after recent developments in fraud and corruption allegations over the Estina Farm Community Project in the Free State where a member of the Gupta family has been implicated. “[The fact ] that law enforcement agencies act only when political leadership changes is a sign of how weak, impartial and subject to political influence they are. This is the most dangerous thing facing our democracy today. I don’t care for the Guptas but the law must be law regardless of who breaks it,” Ndlozi said. Ndlozi said that the law should not be selective, irrespective of the perpetrators. Ajay Gupta was recently declared a fugitive by the police following his failure to make contact with the Hawks who issued a warrant for his arrest. He is wanted in connection with the pending charges relating to the allegations of fraud and corruption over Estina Farm Community Project in the Free State. Last week, eight people accused of fraud, corruption and money laundering relating to the Vrede farm dairy project were granted bail of between R10 000 and R200 000 by the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court. In a statement, the police said that the ministry had issued an alert to all border posts to be vigilant and make sure that the suspects do not get “smuggled” out of the country. -TNA Reporter
