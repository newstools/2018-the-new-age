The Film and Publication Board (FPB) has announced that it has revised its rating on the controversial movie Inxeba (The Wound) that will lead to the movie being stopped from playing in cinemas. “The Film and Publication Board (FPB) Appeal Tribunal has overturned the classification rating of 16 LS given to the film Inxeba – The Wound and gave it a rating of X18 with the classifiable elements of Sex, Language, Nudity, Violence and Prejudice,” FPB said in a statement. The revision was published on the Film and Publication Board’s Twitter account on Wednesday. According to the latest revision, the movie will be ‘banned’ from cinemas or any other platform and can only be distributed from designated adult premises. “The Chairperson of the Appeals Tribunal in consultation with other tribunal members agreed to hear the appeal based on applications lodged by CONTRALESA Gauteng and The Men and Boy Foundation,” FPB said. The Publication Board says that the complaints from CONTRALESA were largely based on the perceived cultural insensitivity and distortion of the Xhosa Circumcision tradition and strong language that is contained in the film. The film has received criticism following its release with claims that it violates the sanctity of cultural practices, which by nature are secret. This led to cinemas in the Western Cape stopping its screening following protest from members of the public. Meanwhile, the Publication Board says that reasons to revise the classification of the movie to X18 will be shared once they have been finalized. -TNA Reporter
