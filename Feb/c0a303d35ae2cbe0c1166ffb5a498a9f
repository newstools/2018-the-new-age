AFTER a prolonged public spat with the original winner, fashion designer David Tlale officially crowned Keletso Moraba as the new season 1 title holder of the reality TV show The Intern. Moraba, who was a runner up was crowned at a star studded event, the David Tlale Premium Gala at the Rand Club, Johannesburg earlier this week. This comes after the renowned fashion guru encountered hurdles with the initial winner Kuena Moshoeshoe for what has been referred to as breach of the contestant agreement, resulting in her being disqualified. Since her victory as the winner of the SABC3 show in October, the Lesetho-born designer has been locked in a bitter war of words with Tlale, saying she was “tired of being treated like sh*t” by the designer’s camp after she was made to wait too long for her prizes. “The producers of the show and I have met and, after consulting with our legal teams, decided we had to bring this matter to a head. “Even though we did everything in our power, we have yet to receive any formal response from Moshoeshoe and we have decided to award Moraba instead,” he said. “Now I look forward to focusing on what this programme is really about and that is to empower and work with the next generation of extraordinary young designers.” It is reported that Moraba has already started his duties as the intern assistant designer for the House of David Tlale. The prizes he won include a yearlong internship at the House of David Tlale, R200000 in cash, a new Mercedes-Benz CLA and a design studio valued at R250000. nontokozog@thenewage.co.za
