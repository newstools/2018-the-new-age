The Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has postponed his visit to report back to people of Manguzi in KwaZulu-Natal. Mbalula together with Saps National Police Commissioner General Khehla Sithole visited the Manguzi community following requests to meet the police leadership. The community called on the government to intervene in motor vehicle theft and general crime in the area and the Mozambique border. Minister Mbalula reiterated his understanding that people’s protests are not isolated from the challenges experienced by the police in fighting crime. “Our people are not protesting for the sake of it, they do so because there is a real concern and their government must listen to them. The people of Manguzi have been complaining about cross-border crime and theft of motor vehicles and this is a serious concern.” He promised the community that he would return on the 16th of February with a strong response and intervention. Mbalula said due to the ongoing developments in parliament and the country, a new date will be communicated in due course. The Minister’s visit was to respond to the call and get first-hand information from the people on how Saps can intervene. -TNA Reporter
