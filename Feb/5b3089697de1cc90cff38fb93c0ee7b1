The ANC Women’s League (ANCWL) says the DA has not yet accepted that Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s appointment was unanimous. The Women’s League said the DA was hiding under parliamentary privilege and immunity when it accused Mkhwebane of being a former spy, adding that the party’s leader Mmusi Maimane used every platform to tarnish her image. “The DA’s call that Mkhwebane must be removed after the court ruled that Absa must not pay back the money received from the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) is nothing but to ensure that the court ruling is not appealed. The Public Protector has a right to appeal or not appeal the court ruling on CIEX-Absa report,” the ANCWL said in a statement. “The DA projects itself as defenders of democracy but its interpretation of democracy is that all crimes of looting state resources and killing of black people committed under the apartheid government must be left unchallenged.” The statement further said it was not surprising that the DA was in support of THE CIEX-Absa court ruling. On Friday, the North Gauteng High Court set aside Mkhwebane’s Bankorp-CIEX report in which she had ordered Absa to pay back a bailout it received from the Reserve Bank to the tune of R1.125 billion. The court also set aside Mkhwebane’s remedial action. The court further held the Public Protector liable to pay for the legal cost of the defendants. The judgment meant that she would personally pay 15% of the Sarb’s costs and the rest would be paid by her office. At the same time, the ANCWL has accused the DA of embracing black members who succumb to the arrogance of the DA’s white caucus. “For the DA, a united, non-racial and prosperous South Africa means the ownership of land and the economy must remain in the hands of the minority.” -TNA Reporter
