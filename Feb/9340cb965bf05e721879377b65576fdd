The City of Johannesburg on Wednesday announced that it would soon complete the insourcing of 4 000 contract security workers. This follows the city’s commitment to bringing critical functions into the city during the State of the City Address last year. Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba acknowledged the role played by the EFF in working with the DA to address the matter. Mashaba indicated that currently, the city was outsourcing security services through over 150 contracts with service providers. “The city has paid on average R14 000 per security guard while the guards themselves received as little as R4 500 as a salary per month,” Mashaba said. Mashaba also stated that the city was undergoing an extensive process of ensuring the smooth integration of the security personnel while guaranteeing the financial sustainability of the entire operation. “Due to the complexities of local government regulations, cases of corruption, contractual commitments and legal considerations, the time taken to implement this process has been considerable.” -TNA Reporter
