The City of Johannesburg is offering R100 000 to anyone who has information about the shooting incident which resulted in a JMPD officer being shot in the head. It is alleged that the officer D.A. Ratshikhopha, 47, was shot in the head when he tried to prevent a minibus taxi from being hijacked near Pat Mbatha Busway & Old True Road in Booysens on Tuesday morning. This recent attack comes a week after a Joburg Emergency Manager Services (EMS) ambulance was attacked in Honeydew whilst transporting a pregnant woman to the hospital. Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba said, “this criminal behaviour must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. As no arrests have been made, I have requested that the Chief of JMPD David Tembe and MMC for Public Safety Michael Sun use all means at their disposal to apprehend the suspects”. He added that in the pursuit of keeping the residents of Johannesburg safe, I must first and foremost ensure may law enforcement officials are safe when conducting their work. “This is why we are offering this reward and by doing so, someone will come forward with information which will lead to the arrest of the suspects.” -TNA Reporter
