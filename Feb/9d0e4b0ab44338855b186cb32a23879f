The Competition Commission has on Thursday announced that four companies have been referred for prosecution in the Tribunal for price fixing and tender collusion involving an Eskom tender worth R4.5 billion. This follows a complaint lodged by Eskom and a subsequent Commission investigation into collusive tendering for the supply, installation and dismantling of scaffolding and thermal insulation for all of the 15 Eskom coal-fired power stations. The Commission’s investigation found evidence of price fixing and collusive tendering by Waco Africa (Pty) Ltd, SGB Cape, Tedoc Industries (Pty) Ltd, Mtsweni Corrosion Control (Pty) Ltd and Superfecta Trading 159 CC. The Commission also found that SGB Cape concluded bilateral agreements with each of Tedoc Industries, Mtsweni Corrosion Control and Superfecta Trading to form three separate joint ventures to be used to tender collusively. SGB Cape was found to have priced the bids in such a way that it manipulated prices quoted by itself and the respective joint ventures. The Commission received Eskom’s complaint in which it alleged that SGB Cape and the three joint ventures may have colluded when bidding for the tender. Eskom suspected collusion when SGB Cape submitted multiple tenders which one was its own and the other three were as a member of joint ventures. -TNA Reporter
