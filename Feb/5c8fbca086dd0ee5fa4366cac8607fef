Much debate and mixed reactions continue to follow The Film and Publication Board (FPB) decision to revise the rating of award-winning local film Inxeba (The Wound) to X18. On Friday the CRL Rights Commission announced that it “fully supports” the review announced by the FPB on Wednesday. The commission had made representations following complaints it received from citizens agitating for the age restriction. The FPB gave the film a rating of X18 with the classifiable elements of Sex, Language, Nudity, Violence, and Prejudice. According to the Commission, it is hoped that the reclassification would bring to an end to the unrest and at times violence which has dogged the film and crew since its local release. “The CRL Rights Commission calls for calm and urges everyone to stop the death threats targeted at the crew or cast members and appeals to those who might be involved in demonstrations and pickets to do that within the ambit of the law as it is a criminal offense to threaten anyone” CRL spokesperson Mpiyakhe Mkholo said. According to the latest revision, the movie will be ‘banned’ from cinemas or any other platform and can only be distributed from designated adult premises. However, not everyone is pleased with the FPB decision. Civil society group the Right2Know Campaign has rejected the films reclassification as an act of homophobic censorship. “We view this as censorship, censorship that silences the voice of the LGBTIQ community, and violates the constitutional right to freedom of expression. As the FPB has yet to publish reasons for this decision, R2K sees it as a dangerous and gross overreach of the FPB’s authority,” the group said in a statement. Previously The Wound’s opening weekend was hampered when 16 cinemas, most of them in the Eastern Cape and Cape Town, were unable to screen the film. The film managed to take home just more than R600 000 with just 19 screens instead of the usual 55 screens. -TNA Reporter
