The Democratic Alliance (DA) has welcomed the decision by the Public Service Commission (PSC) to launch an investigation into possible abuse of office by Minister of Public Service and Administration, Faith Muthambi. “For far too long, Minister Muthambi has ‘got away with murder’ in her brazen attempt to turn the ministry into an employment agency for the politically connected few. “Money that could have been better spent creating a more accessible Public Service, was diverted to hire excess food aides, drivers and administration assistants,” DA’s Shadow Minister of Public Service and Administration Desiree Van der Walt said. This investigation comes after a plea by DA to the PSC last week requesting it to probe Muthambi after allegations that she had expanded her stuff with about 40 people where most of those were alleged to be friends and members of her family. The commission then wrote back to the DA informing it that the probe was to be initiated. “The PSC has assigned commissioner B Luthuli, the cluster commissioner for the department of public service and administration, to lead an investigation team to conduct an investigation into the regularity in the filling of posts within the ministry,” reads the response letter from the commission. The DA said that the allegations against Muthambi are such that she may have violated the ministerial handbook “which only makes provision for 10 appointees in the Minister’s private office”. According to the DA, the alleged conduct by the minister “has been enabled by an ineffectual leader of government business, Cyril Ramaphosa who has not acted while the rot festered”. “We look forward to a timely conclusion of the investigation and appropriate action to be taken on the Minister.” -TNA Reporter
