Property mogul Jason Rohde has until 12:30 on Monday to appear in the Western Cape High Court after the court was told that he would not be appearing due to illness, without having provided a medical certificate to the judge. Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlope ordered that Rohde be taken from the medical facility he is at and be brought to court. Rohde is accused of murdering his wife Susan at the Spier Hotel during a work function in July 2016 and faces charges relating to obstruction of justice for making the death look like a suicide. Susan’s death was initially thought to have been a suicide but a  post-mortem later revealed that she was strangled with a phone cord. Rohde’s alleged mistress was also in attendance and it is believed that her presence resulted in conflict between the two women. Rohde claimed that he found his wife in the bathroom of their hotel suite with an electrical hair iron cord around her neck. -TNA Reporter
