Police Minister Fikile Mbalula announced on Sunday that the police had arrested six of the “masterminds” behind the killings of union leaders in Marikana, Rustenburg. “I am elated that last night we managed to bring six of those brains behind the killings,” Mbalula said. The police said that in total nine suspects had been arrested, three of whom were “trigger pullers” and six the police believe to be the “main brains” behind the killings directed at union members in the mining town. Mbalula made the announcement in Rustenburg while giving a report back on the progress made in investigations into the killings of union leaders, mostly Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) members. “In that systematic killing of people it was quite clear that these were assassinations.” Mbalula said it was important work, taking down those who that mattered most in society because the police usually arrested “minions” who were employed to kill but couldn’t find the main brains behind the killings. He further cautioned those in other provinces that are volatile with political killings and assassinations that the long-arm of the law was going to find them. “And it does not mean that even those that have engaged in such activities in KZN and everywhere else we will not find them, it may be so-called political killings and so on, we will find them.” Mbalula said that some of the individuals arrested had been found in the Eastern Cape and the Marikana area. -TNA Reporter
