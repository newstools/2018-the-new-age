IF THERE is one thing Ryan Moon does not want to happen to him it is to become big-headed. The Kaizer Chiefs striker is enjoying an impressive run of form, having netted five goals in all competitions in the last five matches. Moon is becoming the favourite of Amakhosi supporters and if he continues finding the net he could well be picked for the Bafana Bafana international friendly next month. But Moon is not even thinking that far ahead as he insists his aim is to continue keeping Chiefs in the PSL title race. “It’s everyone’s dream to play for the national team but at the moment I’m not thinking about that,” Moon said. “I’m thinking about Bloemfontein Celtic and Orlando Pirates coming up in our next matches and giving a good performance. “I just want to continue scoring and take it game by game. I would love to be in the Bafana team but it is about taking it game by game and not getting ahead of myself.” Becoming big-headed is something Moon is determined to avoid. While he still feels there is a lot he can improve on, he said he must keep his feet on the ground and focused on the work ahead. “I think that’s the most important thing. Our goal as youngsters is to play overseas, so definitely for now it is to work hard, keep my feet on the ground and take it one game at a time. “Obviously is not easy to go overseas and play for a good club, it will need a lot of hard work.” After initially failing to break into the starting line-up since his move from Maritzburg United last season, the 21 year old is now confident he will see out this season on a high. “You have to work hard at training, you need to show your performance. “The way you train is the way you play, so for me I have been doing well in training, scoring goals and combining nicely with the other players,” he said. -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
