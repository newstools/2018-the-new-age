The Hawks were raiding journalist and author Jacques Pauw’s house in Riebeek-Kasteel, Western Cape on Wednesday. Pauws reportedly said the Hawks just knocked on his door, searched the house, guesthouse and the restaurant for any secret documents. According to the search warrant, Pauw has violated the Protection of Information Act and the Intelligence Services Act. In his book The President’s Keepers  that was released last year, Pauw  revealed the tax affairs of former president Jacob Zuma‚ including that he was paid a salary of R1-million a month for at least four months after becoming president in 2009. According to Pauw‚ payments were made by a Durban businessman Roy Moodley. This revelation resulted in SARS making threats to take legal action against him. -TNA Reporter
