The Executive Mayor of the City of Cape Town Patricia De Lille has said that she wants to ensure that the councilors who are expected to vote, exercise their right without fear or intimidation. In an interview, De Lille emphasised that there has been intimidation in the DA caucus. “I have always maintained that I am not against the motion of no confidence but I am concerned about the fairness of the process.” The Western Cape High Court will deliver judgment on De Lille’s secret ballot application tomorrow, before the vote of no confidence motion that will take place on Thursday. De Lille’s legal counsel Advocate Dali Mpofu said the DA’s motion of no confidence is a back door disciplinary proceeding in disguise. Mpofu said the court should protect the DA councilors who will vote in favour of De Lille  against any backlash for defying the party’s leadership. “The judgment will give clarity to whether the councilors want to vote for or against the motion of no confidence.” -TNA Reporter
