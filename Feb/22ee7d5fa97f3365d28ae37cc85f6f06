A businessman from Fordsburg is due to appear at the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court for attempting to bribe a City official for the installation of four electricity prepaid meters at a cost of R8000. The businessman’s appearance comes after his arrest on Thursday during a Buya Mthetho operation in Fordsburg. SAPS officials were shocked to find four bridged prepaid electricity meters and a bypassed water meter. Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba said he is happy that operation Buya Mthetho in its first few days is yielding positive results. “I would like to commend the official who refused to be associated with corrupt activities. Working with such dedicated officials I have no doubt in my mind that these daily operations will be a huge success.” Operation Buya Mthetho is a new multi-departmental operation aimed at enforcing by-laws and bringing the rule of law to the City of Johannesburg. Mashaba indicated that the operation will be conducted on a daily basis, as a ward based “raid” initiative. “The operation will focus on ensuring that city by-law will be adhered to by all within the City and that the rule of law becomes the order of the day,” he said. -TNA Reporter
