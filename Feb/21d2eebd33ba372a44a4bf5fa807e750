CITY of Tshwane’s MMC for utility services, Darryl Moss, will unveil the upgraded Groenkloof pump station which supplies water to residents and businesses in the Pretoria CBD today. The renewed operation of the pump station has been made possible through a donation of R3m by the SAB and AB InBev resulting in the city saving R30m per year. Moss said the contribution was in line with the company’s objectives to support initiatives that were linked to water conservation in the city. The donation went towards the refurbishment of the machinery which has now been modernised. “The completion of this project has alleviated some of the water related challenges that the city could have experienced,” Moss said. “In addition, the project has now contributed to the overall objective of providing affordable and sustainable water services to all our customers. This is part of the administration’s strategy to reduce dependence on Rand Water supply by expanding utilisation of the city’s own water resources.” He said although the city had ensured optimum maintenance on the pump system, the equipment had finally reached the end of its serviceable lifespan and became inoperable primarily due to mechanical failure, which resulted in large volumes of potable water being lost into the Apies river. The estimated yield from the Groenkloof Lower Fountain pump station is 9 600kl per day and if not operational the municipality would have been compelled to purchase additional water from a service provider at a cost of approximately R80000 per day. ntombin@thenewage.co.za -NTOMBI NKOSI
