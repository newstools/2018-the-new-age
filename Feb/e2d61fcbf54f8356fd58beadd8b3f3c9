EFF said it has given National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete until 10 am tomorrow to respond to the party’s letter calling for her to bring forward a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma next week. Failure to do so will see the party approaching the court. The announcement was made by leader Julius Malema during the opposition parties’ briefing on the way forward following the ANC’s failure to remove President Jacob Zuma from his post. The EFF initially wrote to Mbete to table a motion of no confidence against Zuma which she scheduled for 22 February. EFF, DA, ACDP, FF+ and COPE said once the interim president to succeed Zuma is chosen, they will then call for the dissolution of parliament for an early election to be held. Malema said parliament has been on numerous occasions found to have not been able to hold the executive to account. “This is not only about the removal of President Zuma, this is also about us. Several courts, including the constitutional court, have criticised us for failing to deliver on our promises to South Africans.” DA leader Mmusi Maimane said right now, as opposition parties, they are not concerned about what is going on, at the discussion of the ANC’s leadership currently taking place in Centurion. “ANC’s failure to remove Zuma is a clear indication that they do not care about the country. “It is quite clear that the ANC NEC members have chosen the party above all South Africans.” Last week the parties announced that they were giving the ANC until the end of today to remove President Zuma from his post. -TNA Reporter
