The Automobile Association (AA) said the announced 52 cents increase of fuel and Road Accident Fund levies is a cause of great concern. This follows Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba’s Budget Speech, where he announced that the increases will come into effect on the 1st of April. AA said that it has called on the government to be careful in determining future hikes to the levies, and must consider the impact the increase will have in the poorest of the poor in the country. “At the time we also argued that any increases should be in line with inflation which was at its lowest since March 2015 at 4.4%. Instead the increases are sizable, and more than double current inflation.” The association added that the increases will place an extra burden on all road users especially on the poor who mostly rely on public transport. Looking at the current fuel prices, the Association said the increases will compromise 38% and 39% of a litre of 93 unleaded petrol. “This 52 cents a litre hike in the fuel levies more than wipes out the 30 cents gain realised in the fuel price in January.” -TNA Reporter
