DStv subscribers have been urged to brace themselves as MultiChoice is increasing subscription fees from 1 April. The subscription fees are expected to increase by 2.5%, half of the 4% price hike from last year. MultiChoice has said that the DStv Premium subscriptions fee hike is part of overall DStv subscriptions, which have been steadily declining over the past few years and that has indicated that subscribers no longer see it as offering as much, or enough value, to justify the high price. DStv Compact Plus going up from R489 to R509 per month, DStv Compa will increase from R365 to R385 per month, DStv Family will increase from R235 to R249 per month, DStv Premium will increase from R789 to R809 per month and the DStv Access will remain unchanged at R99 per month. And DStv EasyView will also remain unchanged at R29 per month. -TNA Reporter
