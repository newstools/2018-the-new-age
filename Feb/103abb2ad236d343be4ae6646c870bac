City of Johannesburg Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba has demanded an apology from The Sowetan newspaper for “incorrect reporting”, or face being reported to the Press Ombudsman. This comes after the paper reported on Monday that Mashaba had hired Lephatsi Financial Services, his wife’s company, to fix the city’s financial problems. Mashaba said that his wife had also approached the publication to demand an apology. “She doesn’t understand why she must be involved in this matter in her personal name, in her company, so there are two demands,” Mashaba said. “The Sowetan was given until 10am [Tuesday] to give us a response. If the response is not what I expect, unfortunately, I have the right to go to the Press Ombudsman to really stop journalists being used by malicious political parties that are there to exploit our people.” Mashaba denied the allegations in a statement earlier this week and also pledged to subject himself to the court of law to clear his name. Mashaba is accused of using his wife’s company in the implementation of a project in-sourcing security personnel into the city. In clarifying the matter, Mashaba said that in the process leading to the implementation of the project he acquired the services of a former business associate to assist the city with the financial modeling of the project. The business associate then approved the service “free of charge”. In a statement earlier this week, Mashaba accused the ANC of having solicited the service of the journalist to tarnish his name in an effort to block the implementation of the in-sourcing of thousands of security personnel the city. The in-sourcing of the security personnel is due to start in March this year. -TNA Reporter
