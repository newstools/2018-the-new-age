ANC Chairperson Gwede Mantashe has slammed the media for trying to influence the outcome of negotiations between President Jacob Zuma and party President Cyril Ramaphosa. Mantashe at the weekend called on the media to give the party space and an opportunity to discuss issues affecting it and the future of Zuma without being rushed. He was speaking at the ANC’s 106 birthday celebrations at Lukwatini Stadium in Mpumalanga on Saturday. He said the leadership of the ANC was meeting with Zuma to discuss issues affecting the party, and they should be given space to do so. “The media has tried to set the agenda for us. We are going to meet with the president as the leadership of the ANC. I think there’s an agreement on the end game and where we should end. We must be allowed to resolve a very complex situation carefully,” Mantashe said. Mantashe said ANC officials should be fearless and able to make difficult decisions but have to analyse and mitigate the risks involved. -TNA Reporter
