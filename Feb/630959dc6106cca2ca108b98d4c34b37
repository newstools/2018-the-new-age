Kim Kardashian is still revelling in the success of her recent fragrance launch, but it looks as though she already has another beauty product up her sleeve. The reality TV star and beauty entrepreneur has taken to Instagram to reveal that she has a lipstick (and possibly more than one) in the works. Uploading a photo of herself sporting a matte, taupe shade of lip colour over the weekend, she published the caption: “@kkwbeauty lipstick coming soon.” An image published on the official Instagram page of her makeup brand KKW Beauty seems to confirm the news. The picture shows Kardashian posing for Vogue Taiwan, wearing makeup shades from her previously released “Powder Contour and Highlight Kit,” in addition to a creamy brown lip hue, which the brand refers to a “a sneak peek of something new coming soon.” The launch will mark Kardashian’s first makeup product of 2018, following on from the release of her ‘Ultralight Beams’ powders and glosses back in December. That collection comprised five shimmery loose powders and five high-shine glosses in dazzling metallic gold, copper and bronze hues — a palette she could well be championing with the lipstick launch, judging by her clues so far. Lipsticks have traditionally been Kardashian’s younger sister and fellow cosmetics entrepreneur Kylie Jenner’s territory — so much so, that the duo teamed up on a limited-edition range of ‘KKW Beauty by Kylie Cosmetics’ liquid lipsticks last year. -Relaxnews
