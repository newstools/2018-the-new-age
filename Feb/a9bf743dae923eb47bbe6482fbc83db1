The Parliamentary Chief Whips Forum meeting that was summoned to take place on Wednesday morning has been postponed to 14:00 pm. This was confirmed by UDM and ANC Chief Whips office who said that the information was communicated to them through an email. The ANC in Parliament is expected to hold its caucus which will be followed by the meeting. It is speculated that the caucus is set to discuss the implications of the NEC resolution that announced that the party would recall President Zuma. EFF chief whip Floyd Shivambu said President Jacob Zuma needs to fall on the sword, on Wednesday as he is expected to make an announcement on the ANC NEC resolution to recall him. He said that Zuma should respond or expect the chief whips forum meeting to take action on him. “The man has to fall on his sword today or face dire consequences. Parliamentary chief whips forum is meeting at 14H00 to talk about how he will be pushed onto the sword if he doesn’t do it. South Africa shouldn’t be held at ransom by one individual.” Opposition parties said there was no reason given for the postponement. -TNA Reporter
