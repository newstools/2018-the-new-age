Beauty mogul and celebrity tattoo artist Kat Von D have already dominated the makeup and body art scenes — and now, she has footwear in her sights. The cosmetics entrepreneur, who has been teasing details of the upcoming shoe line for months, has finally taken to social media to clarify a few things about the project. An Instagram post by the star reveals that the collection, dubbed “Von D Shoes,” will launch later this year, and will comprise 28 different styles, covering furry moon boots, sandals, sneakers and platforms, amongst other styles — with some unisex pieces thrown in for good measure. The line will be completely vegan and cruelty-free, with pieces handmade in Italy in sizes 5 through 12. The newly-instated Instagram account @vondshoes offers up a sneak peek at a pair of red patent leather platforms, some black crocodile vegan leather stilettos with bone detailing, and a red foiled vegan leather pair with an extreme platform. If the success of her cosmetics brand Kat Von D Beauty is anything to go by, then we can expect the shoes to become a fashion hit within no time at all. Since being founded in 2008, the brand has grown to become one of the leading labels to champion vegan, cruelty-free color cosmetics, incorporating fragrances, cosmetics and makeup tools. -Relaxnews
