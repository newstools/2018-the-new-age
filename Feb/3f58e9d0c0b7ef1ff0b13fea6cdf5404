Fees Must Fall student activist Mcebo Dlamini’s trial date has been set for 2 March. He appeared briefly in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. The former Wits University student leader is facing charges of theft‚ assault‚ public violence and malicious damage to property. During his previous appearance, the state prosecutor reportedly required more time to provide the court with video evidence relating to the charges that Dlamini is facing. Meanwhile, Dlamini is reported to be frustrated about the delays of the case, which is affecting his preparation for the final examinations set to begin on 18 October. His case was postponed after a brief appearance in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court last month after his lawyer failed to avail himself. Dlamini told the court that his lawyer had to seek medical attention. He was arrested in October last year at the University’s residence following the Fees Must Fall student protests for free education. The protests brought universities to a standstill, followed by violent clashes with the police as students vowed to fight for free education. The protests came to end in 2016 when it was announced that there would be a no fees increase for the 2017 academic year. Dlamini was later granted R2 000 bail and released in November 2016. The activist has constantly pronounced that the case against him was politically motivated.
