The ANC in Limpopo on Friday announced it would be rescheduling its provincial conference to April. This comes after a Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) meeting, which was held at the Park Hotel in Mokopane on Sunday. During the meeting, the ninth provincial conference was rescheduled to take place from 13 to 14 April. In November, the PEC adopted a road map towards the provincial conference. There is a slight delay in the implementation of the road map that has necessitated the revision of the provincial conference dates. The leadership also took the opportunity to discuss the party’s 54th National Conference and allegations of bogus delegates. It said the PEC was concerned that Limpopo was dodged with allegations of bogus delegates at the conference. “These allegations, unless cleared with each affected branch and explained to the delegates at the forthcoming provincial conference, will remain an albatross over the term of this outgoing PEC. The PEC deemed it important to engage in a process that would clarify both the perception and facts of these allegations,” provincial secretary Nocks Seabi said. “The PEC resolved to establish a team that would be led by the ANC Limpopo Veterans League to deal with this matter. All affected branches and delegates to the 54th National Conference must be interacted with by the said team.” -TNA Reporter
