Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula has welcomed the ‘Take Down Operation’  in the Ngcobo Police murder. Following an attack that claimed the lives of five police officers, National Commissioner General Khehla Sithole together with Mbalula visited Ngcobo and instructed police officers to bring the suspects to justice within 72 hours. On Friday in a ‘Take Down Operation’ , the police arrested ten suspects and killed seven, recovering stolen guns and ammunition. The suspects were found in the church premises, where they have been hiding. Mbalula has extended his gratitude for a good job, saying they must continue to assert the authority of the state and affirm rule of the law. “Police arrested suspected criminals in a satanic place masquerading as a church. Our people must be vigilant and report these kinds of places,” Mbalula said. He urged the community to continue working with the police for a peaceful and prosperous South Africa. -TNA Reporter
