The Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF) has welcomed President Cyril Ramaphosa’s maiden State of the Nation Address (Sona), which he delivered in the National Assembly on Friday. The forum is optimistic that the president’s address presented a positive future for all South Africans. “It is our well-considered view that the economic policies that were extensively debated at the June 2017 ANC policy conference, adopted in the December 2016 National Conference of the ANC, and further cemented in the 2018 January 8th Statement, are more than adequate to provide the required guidance for the ANC-led Cabinet to get on with implementation,” the PPF said in a statement. Ramaphosa delivered the Sona a day after he was sworn in as president. His speech contained a lot of emphasis on building collaborations with the business sector and labour to restore confidence and prevent further investment downgrades. He also announced that government would convene a jobs summit in the coming months to allow stakeholders to come up with practical solutions to deal with the problems of unemployment. “The PPF is warning against perpetual summits, especially when the ANC resolutions are so clear and urgent. Instead, it is more prudent to update the existing National Development Plan to ensure structured implementation.” The  PPF further said it trusts that Ramaphosa will follow through from the Sona and get the ANC to table a motion in Parliament to amend section 25 of the Constitution, to give effect to the expropriation of land without compensation. Ramaphosa said the ANC was determined with the implementation of the expropriation of land without compensation, however, it should be implemented in a way that increases agricultural production and improves food security. -TNA Reporter
