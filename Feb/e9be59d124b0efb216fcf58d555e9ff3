RECORD company Mabala Noise is reported to have closed its doors. The latest reports come just after an exodus of some of its stars including co-founder DJ Bongz, Gigi Lamayne and Riky Rick who all left the company in the past year. Last month its founder and ANC youth league leader Reggie Nkabinde said he would be returning to full-time politics where he hopes to succeed ANC Youth League president Collen Maine. Yesterday fans on social media confirmed that the company, launched in 2016, has called its quits after its biggest signing Nasty C jumped ship to join Universal Music Group. Hip hop artist and one of the remaining signees Du Boiz said he still regards himself as an employee and artist of the label. “As far as I know, I am still recording music in studio under Mabala Noise. “I’ve noted speculation from the public about its shutting down but I still perform and get paid so I cannot comment on executive decisions made by my bosses,” the Celebration hit maker said. The Durban-born rapper who has won awards with the company said: “I am just an employee, if they shut down they will let us know.” nontokozog@thenewage.co.za
