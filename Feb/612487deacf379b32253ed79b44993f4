Gauteng police have discovered some of the Life Esidimeni patients that were reported missing when transferred to NGOs. The patients are part of the 62 that were listed as missing, following the 2016 Life Esidimeni tragedy. “I have been informed by police that they have found 5 of the 62 patients that were listed as missing since they were discharged from Life Esidimeni in mid-2016. “Three of these patients are at the Mosego Home in Krugersdorp which the Health Ombudsman ordered closed after 7 patients died there,” DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, Jack Bloom said. According to DA, another patient was discharged from Mosego Home last year in October. Police told Bloom that one patient is reported to be deceased but could not provide details on the circumstances of his death. The DA says that it has on Wednesday wrote to the Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa to immediately remove these patients from the facility and place them at a reputable institution. Following the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings that were taking place since last year in Parktown, Johannesburg it was announced on Thursday that the families of the victims will each be paid an amount of R200 000. The announcement was made by the legal representative of families of the 55 patients. Section 27 advocate Adila Hassim who represents the families of 55 patients who died said the state had agreed to pay each family R20 000 for funeral arrangements and R180 000 for emotional trauma and counselling. -TNA Reporter
