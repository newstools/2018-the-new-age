Several African diplomats will join city of Johannesburg Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba as he embarks on the city’s second A Re Sebetseng monthly clean-up campaign for 2018. Ambassadors of Rwanda, Eritrea, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Zambia and Algeria have all confirmed their presence at the monthly clean-up campaign, which will take place on Saturday. Mashaba said the clean-up campaign is based on what was implemented in the city of Kigali in Uganda called Umuganda, which sets the standard for a clean city and the benefits thereof. He said Kigali is now lauded as Africa’s cleanest city and A Re Sebetseng draws inspirations from this initiative. The mayor said: “Representatives from Coca Cola, social media influencer Mzee Mbuli, the Diepsloot Small Medium Micro Businesses Forum, Makro Riversands, Wot-If, Shoots & Roots, Diepsloot Crime Busters, Steyn City, Century Properties, DeLoitte, SAPS, Miss Earth SA, Gecko, the Father Blondel Centre, Agents of Change and Eldorado Park Sector 2 Block Committee.” Mashaba said if the city was to be turned into a city that worked, citizens must start with themselves. “We must change our mindset to one where we all take ownership of our communities.” -TNA Reporter
