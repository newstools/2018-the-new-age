ADDINGTON Hospital in Durban will continue to offer minimum services to cancer patients while the department of health in KZN works on procuring and repairing the much needed linear accelerator machines that are essential for treatment. The breakdown of two machines meant the province was left with just four machines to serve patients in state hospitals. The crisis was worsened by the mass exodus of oncologists from the public health sector since December 2016, leaving eThekwini without specialists to carry out the treatment for thousands of cancer patients. Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo yesterday said by the end of April both machines should be up and running and Addington cancer treatment services would be restored to full capacity. “Working in conjunction with the national Department of Health we have ensured the Vrala machines are speedily attended to in this manner. “One linear accelerator machine will be replaced by a new one and the second will be repaired. Software will also be upgraded to the latest version. Both machines will be commissioned at the end of April,” Dhlomo said. Dhlomo said the department was partnering with the Wits Health Consortium which would provide three doctors to help clear up the backlog at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital from Monday The team of specialist doctors will work eight hour days for five days a week with the aim of saving thousands of lives and reducing patient working times. “We can report that once the machines are up and running at Addington Hospital. The Wits Health Consortium is in the position of providing two more oncologists to offer their services to that facility,” Dhlomo said. The temporary band-aid will be a stop gap while the department works on acquiring registrars and personnel. “Our efforts to recruit our own oncologists so far have been unsuccessful,” Dhlomo said. Efforts to drive recruitment had been hampered by the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital losing its status as a teaching. -SIBONGISENI MAPHUMULO
