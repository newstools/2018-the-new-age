The Gauteng Provincial Government has promised to build a monument in honour of the Life Esidimeni deceased. The provincial government announced this during a healing ceremony on Saturday at Freedom Park in Pretoria. Following the post four-month long arbitration process which was chaired by retired Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke. The family committee requested the ceremony in order to help them in their healing process. The healing ceremony follows the death of 144 mentally ill patients after they were moved from Life Esidimeni to various unlicensed NGOs around Gauteng. The ceremony saw affected families in a sad mood as they remembered their loved ones. Gauteng Premier David Makhura said that he is deeply sorry for what happened and promised to assist the families in finding the truth. “I will work with you to make sure that issues are finalised.” He said he will also appoint a panel and a curator to make sure whatever has been promised to the families is implemented. The families were once again told that the report from the NPA will hopefully reveal the truth as what to happened. -TNA Reporter
