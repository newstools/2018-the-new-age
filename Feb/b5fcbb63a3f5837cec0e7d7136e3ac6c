The case against an Eastern Cape DA activist who accused Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Athol Trollip of bribery has been postponed to Friday. Nontuthuzelo Jack from the Tshwete village is facing crimen injuria charges after she accused Trollip of offering her her a bribe to “dig up some dirt” on former DA provincial chairperson Veliswa Mvenya. Jack today also appointed a lawyer after she fired her previous one in August last year during court proceedings. Her other lawyer withdrew from the case after accusing her of not cooperating with him. Jack’s claims against Trollip were published in a local newspaper in the run-up to the 2016 municipal elections. -TNA Reporter
