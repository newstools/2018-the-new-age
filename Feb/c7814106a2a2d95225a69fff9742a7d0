Deputy Minister of Higher Education and Training Buti Manamela engaged with Nehawu delegation and the Durban University of Technology (DUT) management on Tuesday to resolve the strike by workers that is on its 7th week. The workers at the university are demanding a 10% salary increase, bonuses and housing allowances. In a statement on Monday, Nehawu said that the strike needed to be suspended as a matter of urgency in order for the academic year to resume. “As Nehawu, we are committed to engaging all concerned stakeholders in ending the strike and we welcome the commitment by the University Council to return to the negotiation table.” Nehawu General Secretary Zola Saphetha met with the Deputy Minister and DUT Vice-Chancellor to resolve the strike. Manamela was also expected to address the students at the university following his meeting with the unions and management. Meanwhile, the students at the university were also protesting calling for the Academic programme to resume at the institution. EFF student leader and Fees Must Fall Activist Bonginkosi Khanyile expressed solidarity with the workers. “We want to thank the leadership of Nehawu that came to address the issue. We want to tell them one thing, they must not fail to address this issue because if they fail, we have contacted the national leadership of the EFF, they are on standby, if they fail, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi and commander in chief Julius Malema is going to come down,” he said. #DUTStrike #FeesMustFall march gets underway to Steve Biko Campus where deputy minister of higher education Buti Manamela will be holding a meeting @ANN7tv @The_New_Age pic.twitter.com/aLMJrmRp9s — Sibongiseni Maphumulo (@SiboMaphumulo) February 27, 2018 #DUT staff “ready for 10%” salary increases, as near the Steve Biko Campus @The_New_Age @ANN7tv pic.twitter.com/MOgmNIcQRE — Sibongiseni Maphumulo (@SiboMaphumulo) February 27, 2018  -TNA Reporter
