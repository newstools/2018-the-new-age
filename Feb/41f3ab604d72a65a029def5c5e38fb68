Numsa says it is “deeply saddened” by the death of a Gautrain worker who was killed on Wednesday while on duty. The 59-year-old maintenance rail-road driver died when his vehicle, which was towing four train coaches to a workshop in Midrand, left it rails and collided with a building and maintenance equipment. The driver died instantly while two other Gautrain workers, who were on the train at the time, are still recovering in hospital. Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola said it cannot be business as usual when a worker dies on duty. Hlubi said the union has called for an urgent meeting with the management to discuss this breach of health and safety standards which led to the death of a worker and also call on the Railway Safety Regulator to do a thorough investigation to get to the bottom of the incident and to ensure that health and safety standards are met at all times. “We must know what measures are being taken to ensure the safety of all workers. It is vital that we get assurances that this incident will not happen again.” She said the union has instructed its officials to do everything possible to give necessary support to the family of the deceased and offer necessary emotional support. “Furthermore, we will be assisting the family to claim benefits from the company.” -TNA Reporter
