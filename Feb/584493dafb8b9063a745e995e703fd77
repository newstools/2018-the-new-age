Sports federations will have to submit a list of their most important fixtures to the city of Cape Town in order for fields to be watered. This is in line with the city’s announcement of Level 6B water restrictions, which prevents pitches and sports fields from being watered with municipal drinking water. All club cricket in connection with the Western Province Cricket Association, and football in the Premier League first division, second, division and third division have been cancelled with immediate effect. Major soccer fixtures will be played on 29 artificial surfaces across the city, if a need arises. Usage of water for irrigation purposes will also be limited to 1 hour on Tuesdays and Saturdays before 9am and 6pm. The Western Cape is currently in the middle of the biggest water shortage to have ever hit the area in 100 years. It is feared that the city will run out of the water by 16 April. -TNA Reporter
