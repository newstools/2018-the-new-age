The police in the North West are investigating a possible racist attack on South African long-distance runner Thabang Mosiako, which is alleged to have taken place at North West University last week. “At this stage, the investigation is still in process,” police spokesperson Colonel Adele Myburgh said. The police said an arrest had not yet been made but promised to give an update on the case by Monday. Mosiako was hospitalised after being attacked by a group of about 10 men. It is alleged that Mosiako was attacked by a group of 10 white students at the campus during the university’s student fundraising event known as RAG. According to reports, the incident happened after a friend of the athlete stopped the attackers from swearing at a cashier. He told the Rustenburg Herald newspaper that after leaving the shop, the group had multiplied and started attacking them. “There were a lot of them and we did not stand a chance. The two of us fled and the attackers all started kicking Mosiako on the head and body while he was on the ground. I saw one taking his head and repeatedly bashing it against the ground.” The police said the case was regarded as serious and was receiving proper the attention. -TNA Reporter
