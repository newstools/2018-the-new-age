COSATU has called on Deputy President Cyril Rampahosa to take over the management of the Western Cape’s water crisis because “he is the only credible leader at the head of all levels of the government left, who has the confidence of the people”. The trade union federation’s Western Cape secretary Tony Erenreich made the call to Ramaphosa yesterday. He also announced that Cosatu would be meeting business leaders in Cape Town today to discuss measures that could avoid Day Zero. Ehrenreich said that the water crisis has revealed the stunning level of incompetence in the city of Cape Town and provincial government. “The way it is communicated is confusing residence and giving the impression that it is just a circus.” dennisc@thenewage.co.za -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
