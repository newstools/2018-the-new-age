Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba has announced the much-dreaded increase in value-added tax during his 2018/19 budget speech on Wednesday. Delivering the speech in the National Assembly, Gigaba announced a 1% increase in VAT from 14 percent to 15 percent. The finance minister said the increase in VAT alongside a number of other tax proposals announced was done in order to generate an additional R36 billion in tax revenue. With government faced with a staggering R48.2 billion revenue gap economists had long speculated that an increase in VAT was inevitable. “In a low-savings economy, consumption should be taxed but I think a VAT hike is likely to be politically unpalatable ahead of the 2019 national elections in particular,” Standard Bank economist Elna Moolman had warned ahead of the budget. Economists had believed that a 2% VAT hike could be effective in wiping out the revenue shortfall. “We have not adjusted VAT since 1993, and it is low compared to some of our peers. We, therefore, decided that increasing VAT was unavoidable if we are to maintain the integrity
of our public finances,” Gigaba said. Despite the increase, the minister’s announcement was not all bad news as he answered the prayers of many by confirming that the zero-rating on basic food items including maize meal, brown bread, dried beans and rice will remain in place. Alongside VAT Gigaba also announced a 52 cents per litre increase in the levies on fuel. Further good news for poor households came with the news of an above average increase in social grants. The old age, disability and care dependency grants will increase on 1 April 2018 from R1600 by to R1690 while the Child Support grant will increase from the baseline of R380
to R410. Meanwhile, Gigaba also announced an anticipated growth of 1.5 percent in 2018, rising to 2.1 percent in 2020.
