The trial of 14 Marikana residents is expected to resume in the North West High Court in Mogwase on Monday. Aubrey Seitsang, Sibonile Sobopha, Mdlondozi Fundiwo, Herbert Baqhesi, Napoleon Webster and William Nyenyane and eight others are facing murder charges following the death of Sabata Petrus Chale who was hacked with knives and spears in 2014 during unrest in the area. The suspects have since been denied bail. It is alleged that the men killed Chale who was a supply chain manager of the RDP housing project over the allocation of low cost RDP houses in Marikana West, Extension 2. -TNA Reporter
