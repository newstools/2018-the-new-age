Hlaudi Motsoeneng’s CCMA disciplinary hearing that was due to resume was postponed on Monday The former SABC COO is challenging his SABC dismissal at the CCMA where he was fired last year after he was found guilty of contravening the corporation’s code of conduct. The decision was taken following a disciplinary committee sitting. Motsoeneng called a press conference in which he allegedly criticized the SABC’s interim board. The SABC reported that the move comes after the national broadcaster failed to reach an agreement during conciliation at the CCMA in 2017. Motsoeneng’s lawyer Zola Majavu told SABC that they are hoping for the case to be finalised in the next few days. November last year, Motsoeneng said that he was fighting the SABC to have his integrity reinstated. “What is important for me is to fight and go back to the SABC so that I can transform that organisation. “I want to bring my integrity back because people have been tarnishing my name. If you look at the way that the SABC is dealing with the matter, it seems as if Hlaudi was involved in corruption.” -TNA Reporter
