Suspended Eskom head of generation Matshela Koko has resigned with immediate effect. Koko said his resignation was not an admission of wrongdoing or guilt on charges that the company brought against him at a disciplinary hearing. Koko is currently facing charges of misconduct and gross negligence as well as breaching the Eskom code of conduct by attempting to mislead Parliament when he appeared before an investigation into state capture in January. He was suspended and later reinstated in January after he was exonerated by an inquiry which investigated charges of misconduct against him. The former Eskom acting CEO faced six charges including conflict of interest for not declaring a relationship with his stepdaughter whose company won multibillion-rand tenders from Eskom. In his resignation letter to the parastatal, Koko said his resignation was in his best interests and that of his family. “I have good defences to these charges, that have been conveyed to Eskom’s legal representatives but nevertheless consider resignation from my employment to be in my best interests at this time,” Koko said. -TNA Reporter
