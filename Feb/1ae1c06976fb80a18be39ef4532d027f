The Democratic Alliance has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to remove Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown after Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found that she violated the executive ethics code. Mkhwebane said Minister Brown misled Parliament when she said a local consultancy firm Trillian had no contracts with power utility Eskom. “Minister Brown inadvertently misled Parliament in her assertion that there were no other contracts of engagement concluded between Eskom and Trillian,” the Public Protector said in her report. However, the minister blames Eskom officials for misleading her. She said that she received signed off information from the chief financial officer on behalf of the chief executive officer which indicated that no payments were made to Trillian by the utility. At the same time, Mkhwebane instructed President Ramaphosa to take action within 14 days against Brown, whose department oversees enterprises. The Public Protectors report comes amid speculation that the President is considering a cabinet reshuffle to create an effective and strong team. Meanwhile, Congress of the People (COPE) says it welcomes the report and call upon the President to act decisively and fire the Minister. “If President Ramaphosa is an ethical leader who believes in good and clean governance, he will summarily dismiss Lynn Brown as Minister Public Enterprises and immediately eject her from his executive. “South Africa can no longer afford to have Ministers who lie to the People’s Assembly, are untruthful, and act unethically and contra to the interests of South Africa,” Cope President Mosiuoa Lekota said in a statement. He further adviced Ramaphosa to put the interest of the country first as opposed to the intra-ANC factional politics and the interests of cohesion as well as unity in the ANC before those of the country. -Sipho Jack
