Police have arrested ten members of a syndicate group on Thursday including three police officers suspected of selling commercial explosives. The gang was arrested after a joint operation between the Hawks’ National Bureau of Illegal Firearms Control and Priority Violent Crimes unit (NBIFCPVC), IPID  and the Crime Intelligence unit. “These arrests are indicative of the effectiveness of collaboration between law enforcement agencies in the fight against organised criminal behaviour. “Our multidisciplinary approach has further demonstrated the ability of law enforcement agencies to work together to investigate, prosecute and disrupt organised criminal groups,” Acting National Head of the Hawks Lieutenant General Yolisa Matakata said. The three police officers are alleged to have been supplying the criminal syndicates with explosives used to bomb ATMs and cash in transit vehicles. “I am extremely disappointed though about the arrest of three police officers. Breaking the very laws we are sworn to uphold is absolutely not acceptable,” she said. The gang is expected to appear before the Fochville and Virginia Magistrates Court on Today. Meanwhile, police say that they are optimistic about more arrests in the matter. -TNA Reporter
