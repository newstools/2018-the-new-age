Democratic Alliance’s Federal Executive Chairperson James Selfe said on Monday that they will be taking Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane Vrede Dairy Farm report to court for review. “We are going to take that report on review because it is so manifestly unsuitable and embarrassingly superficial that it does a huge discredit to the office of the Public Protector and to the constitution of South Africa.” Mkhwebane released the report on the controversial Vrede Dairy Farm in the Free State on Friday. According to the report which has been regarded as a whitewash, the Free State agriculture and rural development department failed to manage and monitor the implementation of the terms of agreement regarding budget evaluations and expenditure control and performance by Estina on the Vrede Dairy farm. However, Selfe says that the report failed to link those officials and individuals that are allegedly implicated in Vrede Dairy farm project. “The Vrede Farm Estina report was so embarrassingly superficial that it’s the biggest belief because it makes some findings around officials but it doesn’t draw the line to those that are politically accountable, most explicitly the Free State Premier Ace Magashule.” The office of the Public Protector including the previous Public Protector Thuli Madonsela both previously pronounced that their office was under-resourced to adequately perform their duties. Selfe said that the parliamentary committee needed to engage with Mkhwebane in this regard to understand the specific resources that her office requires and ask her. “What exactly is the resource you need, why was Adv Thuli Madonsela able to do what you are not able to do with the same resources?.” -TNA Reporter
