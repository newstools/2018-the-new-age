The party’s decision comes after the meeting the party’s highest decision-making body is currently logged in Johannesburg, for the first time this year. “Part of the reconfigured component of the party programme going forward and respect of elections, we must take the along the class with us and part of the class is Cosatu which organized detachment of the working class in South Africa. So we have to have that discussion with Cosatu,” Chris Matlhako the Second Deputy General Secretary said. However, during the party’s 14th Congress that was held in Boksburg, the SACP had resolved to contest future elections beginning with the 2019 national election. While reading the party’s declaration at the time Matlhako said the SACP will definitely contest the election, adding that the party needed to concrete analysis before concluding the matter. “We have resolved that while the SACP will certainly contest elections; the exact modalities in which we do so need to be determined by way of a concrete analysis of concrete reality and through the process of active engagement with the worker and progressive formations,” he said. Meanwhile, the SACP meeting in Johannesburg is also expected to discuss Cyril Ramaphosa’s tenure as the ANC’s President and head of state. The meeting will end on Sunday. -TNA Reporter
