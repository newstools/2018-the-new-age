A body of an infant believed to be between 1-2 months old was found buried in the sand on the beach in Summerstrand. It is alleged that on Sunday a resident was walking her dog on the beach when the dog ran off. The dog found the partially buried infant in the sand. Colonel Priscilla Naidu said that the race and sex of the child cannot be determined due to the advanced state of decomposition. Police have opened an inquest pending the results of the post-mortem report. “We appeal with members of the public to assist in either tracing the parents of the child or anyone who may know of any person who may have given birth recently and no longer is with a child,” said Naidu. -TNA Reporter
