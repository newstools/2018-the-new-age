Seven suspects will on Monday appear at the Kliptown Magistrates’ Court for being in possession of City of Johannesburg stolen property. The suspect’s arrest comes after Joburg citizen’s alerted the City’s Group Forensic and Investigation Service (GFIS) Department on Friday. The city said immediately after receiving a tip-off they dispatched to Kliptown Bagdad flea market adding that upon arrival they discovered that on the city building was stripped off. “The material was then being sold to the public in the market. When the suspects were questioned about where they got the building material from, they became violent and threatened the team. “An operation was then set up by GFIS, the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) and SAPS. The flea market was raided and building material belonging to the City was confiscated by JMPD.” At the same time, City Mayor Herman Mashaba said last year the Soweto Country Club was burgled and the criminals went away with 12 panels of clear view fence. He, however, said the police managed to arrest one suspect on Friday who is believed to be involved in the theft of the panels. “I am happy that the thieves are behind bars and I have no doubt that the SAPS will work around the clock to ensure that everyone involved faces the full might of the law. I would like to commend GFIS, JMPD and the SAPS for the sterling job.” -TNA Reporter
