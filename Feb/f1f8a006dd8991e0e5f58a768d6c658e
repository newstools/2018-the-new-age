ANC branches in KwaZulu-Natal have expressed unhappiness with over a decision by the ruing party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) to recall former President Jacob Zuma. Zuma reluctantly tendered his resignation on Wednesday last week. In a build-up to the party’s elective conference in December, KwaZulu-Natal was the strongest supporter of Zuma’s chosen successor Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma. While announcing the party’s decision to recall Zuma, ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule announced that the party would be deploying two NEC members to each province to explain its decision. On Saturday, NEC members Barbara Creecy and former Treasurer-General Zweli Mkhize were sent to the province to explain the party’s decision when several members from the party’s biggest region, eThekwini, expressed their unhappiness with the manner in which the decision to recall Zuma was communicated to them. “They felt the issues should have been discussed with the structures long before they were out in the media,” Mkhize said. Meanwhile, news website africanews24-7 is reporting that Zuma was forced to resign after he was threatened with expulsion from the party. The site is reporting that the charge for Zuma’s removal was led by ANC Chairperson Gwede Mantashe and Treasurer-General Paul Mashatile. -TNA Reporter
