The Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF) has congratulated Cyril Ramaphosa on his election as president of South Africa. The PPF said Ramaphosa’s election was a major step in providing much-needed certainty in the affairs of South Africa as he was acutely aware of the serious challenges facing South Africa in terms of sluggish economic growth, unacceptably high unemployment and abject poverty, particularly among black people. The organisation was reacting to the election of Ramaphosa on Thursday as president of the country, replacing former President Jacob Zuma, who resigned on Wednesday after being asked to step down by the ANC’s National Executive Committee (NEC). PPF Deputy Secretary-General Zinhle Cele said the organisation trusted that President Ramaphosa would use his good relationships with the business community, both locally and internationally, to bring about greater commitment to investment in South Africa. “The PPF pledges its support to President Ramaphosa and his administration and looks forward to a State of the Nation Address that will put Radical Economic Transformation and the 54th ANC conference resolutions at the centre of government programmes.” “We also bid farewell to former President Jacob Zuma and thank him for his tireless endeavours in the arduous task of bringing about transformation,” Cele said. Cele said all PPF members had a duty and an obligation to work and partner with President
Ramaphosa and his administration to achieve socio-economic liberation that would benefit all the people of South Africa, particularly the poor black majority. -TNA Reporter
