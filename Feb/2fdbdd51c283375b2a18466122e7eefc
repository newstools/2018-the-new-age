Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) on Thursday said the election of President Cyril Ramaphosa represented a fresh opportunity to focus on the urgent task of growing the economy and addressing the key challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment among the youth. BLSA CEO Bonang Mohale said, instead of celebrating, the organisation was calling on the new administration to focus on a few critical areas. “There is no time to celebrate,” Mohale said. Mohale said state-owned enterprises are bankrupt and there is a need to address the leadership, capital structure and governance issues gripping them. “Some public service cases are worse now than they were in 1994. The South African Revenue Service and National Prosecuting Authority used to be our pride and joy but now they are captured.” The BLSA said it stands ready to present its proposal on an emergency socio-economic recovery plan. -TNA Reporter
