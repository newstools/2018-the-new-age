The ANC Youth League (ANCYL) has slammed President Cyril Ramaphosa for overlooking a number of capable young leaders currently serving as Members of Parliament (MPs) and those playing key roles outside government. The league said it expects the new Cabinet to vigorously pursue an agenda informed by the ANC’s 54th National Elective Conference outcomes and the State of the Nation Address (Sona) commitments, to create decent jobs – especially for the youth. The ANCYL was responding to Monday’s Cabinet reshuffle by President Cyril Ramaphosa. While the league said it warmly welcomed the new Cabinet as announced by Ramaphosa, the it said the ANC should now start taking its youth members seriously and assign them serious positions of power and responsibility, because they represent the second layer leadership of the ANC – and the country at large. Youth League spokesperson Mlondi Mkhize said by doing so, the ANC would be investing in its future, as other parties do. “When we speak about renewal, we are also speaking about having trust and faith in youth leadership in the organisation and the state. Even though we respect President Ramaphosa’s prerogative right, as prescribed in the Constitution, to appoint members of the executive, we strongly feel he should have assembled a well-balanced executive drawn from both the old and the new,” Mkhize said. The ANCYL said it is concerned about the inclusion of Nhlanhla Nene to the Finance Ministry from the private sector, as this might create a perception that white monopoly capital remains in control of National Treasury. “The ANCYL leadership collective will seek a bilateral with the ANC’s top six around our concerns and solicit a better way of making sure that concerns of the Youth League always find expression in relation to deployments made by the ANC, in line with the ANC decision of 20% as agreed in the last National General Council.” -TNA Reporter
