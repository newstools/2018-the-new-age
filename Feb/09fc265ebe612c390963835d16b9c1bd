The arrest of Ajay Gupta is not related to the Estina case, Hawks announced on Friday. “Ajay Gupta is not being sought out for the Estina Dairy Project case but is being sought for corruption and there is a warranty of arrest for him,” Acting National Hawks head Lieutenant General Yolisa Matakata said. Matakate said that they are liaising with his lawyers who have written to them. Last week, the Hawks conducted raids in Gauteng and Free State and collected information which was sent to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). Eight suspects were arrested after the raids and have appeared in court where they were subsequently granted bail. The accused Varun Gupta‚ Ashu Chawla‚ Kamal Vasram‚ Ronica Ragavan and Nazeem Howa, the Free State Agriculture head of department Peter Thabethe‚ provincial government official Takisi Masiteng and the national Mineral Resources Department chief of staff Sylvia Dlamini face fraud, theft, corruption and money laundering charges. Matakata indicated that they are still looking for five other suspects for the Estina investigations. -TNA Reporter
