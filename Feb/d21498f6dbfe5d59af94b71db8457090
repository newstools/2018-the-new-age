An EFF member in the Free State has welcomed the dropping of rape charges against one of its members in the provincial legislature, Willie Tshabalala. The charges against Tshabalala were brought in 2015 in the eastern Free State, in Harrismith. EFF leader in the province Kgotso Morapela at the time said the party asked Tshabalala to step aside to allow him time to deal with the case. “Indeed, it was not an easy decision for the EFF to arrive at, as we were shocked by such allegations against one of the disciplined leaders of the EFF and as the party that is against all manner of abuse of women and children, we had to do the right thing by allowing fighter Willie to clear his name. As a disciplined fighter, he understood very well the position of the organisation and accepted whatever decisions were communicated to him,” Morapela said. He said the decision was in line with the party’s principle which says that the EFF will fight against any form of abuse of children and woman. Morapela thanked Tshabalala for displaying excellent discipline and maturity in the way handled the matter. -TNA Reporter
