The NPA is reconsidering a decision not to prosecute former President Jacob Zuma’s son Duduzane on charges of culpable homicide for an accident in 2014. This was confirmed by civil rights watchdog AfriForum on Sunday. “AfriForum’s legal team was informed officially that the National Director of Public Prosecutions, Shaun Abrahams, had decided to reconsider the National Prosecuting Authority’s initial decision not to prosecute Duduzane Zuma, son of former President Jacob Zuma, on criminal charges of culpable homicide,” AfriForum said in a statement. The case relates to a car accident that took place in February 2014 on the M1 motorway in Gauteng which  led to the death of a female passenger, Mekelina Dube, who was in the other vehicle that was involved. Last year, former state prosecutor Gerrie Nel announced, after his departure from the NPA, that he was to start a private prosecution service for AfriForum. He said that the culpable homicide case against Zuma would be the first subject of his private prosecution. “Abrahams’s decision to review the case follows Nel sending a letter on behalf of the Dube family to the NPA at the end of last year to obtain a nolle prosequi certificate, which would have made it possible for AfriForum to privately prosecute Zuma Jr.” The civil rights group said this would be a victory for the victim’s family if the NPA could successfully prosecute Zuma on the culpable homicide charges. “AfriForum cornered Abrahams, because if he again decides not to prosecute Zuma Jr he knows that Nel is ready to continue with the private prosecution. However, if he decides to do his job and prosecute Zuma Jr, it will be a victory for Dube’s family, AfriForum and equality before the law,” AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel said. -TNA Reporter
