Limpopo police have identified the body of a person found burnt beyond recognition in a Mercedes Benz near the R37 road between Lebowakgomo and Burgersfort as that of a police spokesperson. Through an intricate DNA investigation carried out by the police, the body was identified as that of former police spokesperson Mohlabi Lazarus Tlomatsana. Tlomatsana worked as a national corporate communication and media liaison officer at the SAPS head office in Pretoria until his retirement in August 2007. The burnt out car was found in the bushes by a passerby who later alerted the police earlier this month. According to the police, Tlomatsana appeared to have been tied up inside the car before it was set alight. Police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said at this stage the police had not made arrests in connection with the case. “The police have since launched a manhunt for the assailants and nobody was arrested so far. The motive for the incident is unknown at this stage and investigations are continuing,” Ngoepe said. Ngoepe said the police are appealing to anyone with information on the case to contact Captain Richard Boshomane on 0798945501 or Captain Matsobane Chuene on 0824143345. “They can also contact Crime Stop on 08600 10 111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211.” -TNA Reporter
