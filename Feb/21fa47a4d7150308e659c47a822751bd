The Competition Commission of South Africa on Friday announced that it has penalised two major local media companies for fines amounting to millions for price fixing. “Two print media companies have concluded consent agreements with the Competition Commission and agreed to pay fines amounting to millions of rands after they admitted to participating in price fixing and fixing of trading conditions, in contravention of the Competition Act. The two separate agreements were confirmed as orders of the Competition Tribunal today,” the commission said in a statement. The companies that have been penalised are Independent Media and  Caxton & CTP Publishers and Printers Limited. Independent Media are the publishers of The Star, Sunday World, Pretoria News, The Mercury and Isolezwe. Caxton has been fined over R5 million. The company also agreed on several remedies where it will also pay a 25% in bonus advertising space for every rand of advertising space bought by qualifying small agencies for a period of three years. Meanwhile, Independent Media will pay a penalty amounting to over R2 million. This comes after an investigation that was initiated as early as 2011, which uncovered that media houses agreed to offer similar discount rates to advertising agencies that place advertisements with Media Credit Co-Coordinators (MCC) members. The investigation found that the practices restricted competition among the competing companies and amounted to price fixing . Last year, DStv Media Sales was also fined over R22 million by the commission for price fixing. As part of the penalty, it also paid a further R8 million to the Economic Development Fund over  a period of three years. -TNA Reporter
