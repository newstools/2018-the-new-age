ANC member of Parliament (MP) and former African Union commission chair Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma on Sunday refuted media reports claiming that she is quitting Parliament. “Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma vehemently denies false and fake news reports on her fatigue and her resignation from the South African Parliament as contained in the Sunday Times and other publications’ reports of 18 February 2018,” Dlamini Zuma’s representatives statement. According to the report, Dlamini Zuma, who lost to Cyril Ramaphosa in the ANC presidential race last year, is under fatigue and had apparently told the president that she wants to quit as a National Assembly member. Fake news. Imagine crossing boarders by foot to join arms struggle as a teenager then all of a sudden be too tired of Parliament? Never. I don’t quit. Also, these journalists were with me in Parliament on Friday, why didn’t they simply ask me to fact check? https://t.co/i0PJkkLQEh — Dr Dlamini Zuma (@DlaminiZuma) February 18, 2018 The paper reportedly, informed by sources, claimed that Dlamini Zuma had informed the ANC leadership that she was tired and “had enough of politics”. However, Dlamini Zuma has said she is not quitting Parliament. She further said that the publication had in the past reported “several fake news stories” which had been sanctioned by the Press Ombudsman. “Her appeal is that in conducting its duties, the publications in the least do so in a balanced manner and offer her the right to a response in minimum.” Dlamini Zuma was sworn in as an MP in September last year after returning to the country from serving as chairperson of the African Union. “Dlamini Zuma wishes to emphasise that she remains at the service of South Africa as a member of the South African Parliament and no fake news will dissuade her from her duties.” -TNA Reporter
