Polokwane City missed out on an opportunity to move away from the relegation zone after the team was held to a 1-1 draw by struggling Ajax Cape Town on Sunday afternoon at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium. City was sitting in the 14th spot on the league log before this match and playing at home was an advantage for them to slowly move away from the relegation zone. Rise and Shine broke the deadlock in the 69th minute through Walter Musona. But their celebration was short lived when Sibusiso Mbonani scored an own goal after he tried to clear the ball in the box. City coach Bernard Molekwa was entirely unimpressed with his side for failing to defend the 1-0 lead. “I am disappointed with the result. I thought we dominated the game first half, even second half we dominated. We scored and after scoring we just gave them a very simple goal whereby we could have pressed the man on the ball. We were all retreating and that’s why we conceded the goal,” Molekwa said. “We could have won the game, even the chances we created were many. We don’t deserve to get a point, we deserve to get three points.” City will return to action against Bloemfontein Celtic on 18 February at the Dr Molemela Stadium. -TNA Reporter
