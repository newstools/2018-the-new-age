The Gauteng Department of Education officially launched the SGB elections campaign at Seshegong Secondary school in Olievenhoutbosch on Tuesday. Deputy director of Corruption Watch Ronald Lucky Menoe said school governance is a key element in ensuring that quality learning and teaching is achieved. “The objective is to rally parents, teachers, principals and learners to exercise their votes to elect people of integrity so that the schools will be well managed and resourced.” The SGB elections will take place from 01 to 31 March 2018. “If the schools are not governed well it will leave room for corruption and learners will suffer, therefore through this campaign, we will identify those who want to be elected to fill their own pockets,” he said. Moneo said over the past five years Corruption Watch has received more than 2000 complaints of corruption in schools, involving theft of funds and goods, financial mismanagement and tender corruption. Corruption Watch has embarked on an awareness campaign to mobilise the public to participate in the elections, so as to help improve the management and performance of the schools and hold elected members accountable. They will work with government and other stakeholders to assist in the training and skill development of newly elected SGB members. -TNA Reporter
