The Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) together with the South African Revenue Service (Sars) and the Hawks secured a preservation order on 9 February for an amount of R30 million against 13 suspects accused of defrauding the revenue service. The suspects will be charged with defrauding Sars by claiming fraudulent Value Added Tax (VAT) to a tune of R99 million. The NPA said it apprehended the suspects when it conducted search and seizure operations in Pretoria and Durban. “After successful search and seizure operations, by the police’s specialist unit, the Hawks on 31 January, on several properties in Pretoria and Durban, nine accused were arrested and appeared before court on charges of racketeering, fraud, forgery and uttering, money laundering, contravention of the Tax Administration Act 28 of 2011 and contravention of the Value Added Tax Act 89 of 1991.” The three agencies said they are committed to taking drastic action in eradicating the unlawful submission of fraudulent VAT claims which deplete state funds. Meanwhile, on 9 February the AFU obtained a restraint order in terms of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act in the Pretoria High Court, ordering that the property belonging to the 13 defendants and a further seven respondents, be restrained pending the outcome of the criminal case against them. KPMG was appointed as the curator in the matter. The goods listed in the order are among others 17 immovable properties, a Bentley, a Ferrari, three Lamborghini’s, two Porsche’s and a Rolls Royce, gold coins, gold bars, jewelry and watches. -TNA Reporter
