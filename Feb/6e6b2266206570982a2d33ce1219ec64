The police in Gauteng have discovered eight more of the missing Life Esidimeni tragedy patients unaccounted for following their transfers to NGOs in 2016. This was confirmed on Tuesday by DA shadow health MEC and MPL Jack Bloom. “I have been informed by the police that they have found eight more former patients from Life Esidimeni who were listed as missing by the Gauteng health department. Four of the patients were found at the Thuli Home Centre in Orange Farm and two were found at the San Michele Mental Institution in Kwa-Thema, Bloom said. Bloom said that of the eight patients, one had been taken to an unknown institution, according to his nephew, while another was moved by her mother who refused to furnish them with her whereabouts but confirmed that she was still alive. This comes after five more of the 62 patients reported to be missing were also located last week. This brings to 13 the number of cases that have been solved in the past month. However, 49 patients remain unaccounted for. “Twenty-seven of whom do not have ID numbers and seven without full names, so it will be very difficult to trace them.” The patients are among the over 140 mentally ill patients that died after being transferred from Life Esidimeni to different NGO facilities in 2016. According to Health Ombudsman Malegapuru Makgoba, most of the patients died of starvation and a lack of water. -TNA Reporter
