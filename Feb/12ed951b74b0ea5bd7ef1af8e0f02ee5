DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen says although President Cyril Ramaphosa wanted a “new deal” for South Africans, he had to confront and deal with the “ticks” from his own party that have existed in government for the past eight years. “You have been dealt a very bad hand by your own party. I know you want a new deal but the biggest problem you have is that the Ace in your pack is actually a joker,” Steenhuisen said. Steenhuisen was speaking on Monday during a debate on the State of the Nation Address (Sona) Ramaphosa delivered his maiden Sona on Friday. Steenhuisen called on Ramaphosa to have the courage to deal with fellow ANC members and separate his state role with party politics. “The real test of your courage is whether you can stand up to your own associates in the ANC, whether you can put the state before the party and stand for what is right ahead of your own party’s interest.” Steenhuisen took a swipe an Lindiwe Sisulu, accusing her of defending state capture and further warned the president against ANC members who were pretending to work with him while they were against him. However, he pledged the opposition’s support to Ramaphosa. He said the DA had always wanted to be there to expose corruption, prevent the abuse of power and to be there for the poor and the downtrodden, to vote out a “corrupt president”. “But there were others in this House who did everything they could to push down our hands.” -TNA Reporter
