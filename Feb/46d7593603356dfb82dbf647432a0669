The DA has called on the National Prosecuting Authority(NPA) to withdraw an application to overturn a North Gauteng High Court ruling setting aside National Director or Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Shaun Abrahams‘ appointment. DA Federal Chairperson James Selfe was reacting to Sunday media reports that the NPA is closer to charging former President Jacob Zuma, a development Selfe said the DA welcomed. The court ordered the removal of Abrahams as NPA head and at the time ordered that then deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa appoint Abrahams’ replacement as former president Jacob Zuma was too conflicted to appoint a successor. Abrahams and Zuma have both appealed the ruling Selfe said, since his appointment as the head of the NPA, Abrahams had not acted with the required urgency to make sure Zuma had his day in court. “If the NPA is indeed committed to finally charging and prosecuting Zuma, it follows that it must abandon the appeal against the North Gauteng High Court decision which found that the appointment of Abrahams was invalid.” “As Mr Zuma is no longer president, the DA believes that both appeals are now moot and that President Cyril Ramaphosa must show leadership and appoint a new NDPP.” Selfe said this was the only way to restore public confidence in the NPA and to lend integrity to the process to charge Zuma with 783 charges of corruption. “In the new spirit of inclusivity promised by President Ramaphosa, he should involve a parliamentary committee in the appointment of a new NDPP as this will go a long way to dispel the public cynicism that NDPP’s are appointed for political purposes and that they are not people who can apply the law without fear or favour.” -TNA Reporter
