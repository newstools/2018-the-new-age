The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) has welcomed 76 new members who are joining the party from the ANC in eThekwini. IFP Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi personally welcomed the members from ward 110. Former ANC branch secretary Romeo Hulani and his wife Nomthandazo Hulani were among the members welcomed by Buthelezi. Hulani said he was able to recruit 70 members from the ANC to the IFP. As he handed out party T-shirts to new members, Buthelezi discouraged them from destroying their ANC regalia as he does not believe in vandalism.
