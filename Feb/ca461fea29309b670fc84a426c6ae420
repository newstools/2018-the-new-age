The Empangeni Magistrate’s Court has convicted and sentenced a man to two life terms in prison for raping his 13-year-old daughter. The 53-year-old father was found guilty after the court heard how he had repeatedly raped his daughter in 2013. In February 2013, the 13-year-old girl was reportedly at her father’s homestead in the Matshana area in Empangeni. “She was raped by her father and she reported the matter to her stepmother who was not at home on the day of the incident. The local police were called and a case of rape was opened at Empangeni police station,” Captain Nqobile Gwala said. Gwala said a docket was transferred to the Empangeni Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for further investigation and after a thorough investigation, the accused was arrested and charged with rape. KwaZulu-Natal acting police commission Major-General Bheki Langa has welcomed the heavy sentence handed down to the accused. “The accused was expected to look after his child and protect her against being abused by criminals but instead, he raped her. This will serve as a stern warning to would-be criminals who intentionally abuse young children,” Langa said. -TNA Reporter
