#ZumaMustGo march convener Hangwi Maumela has labelled comments made by first lady Thobeka Madiba-Zuma as “very serious threats”. “How in the world will you find the wife of the president going to Twitter to make a serious threat? She didn’t just do those things alone. There is an influence somewhere to say go and provoke them so that they are going to be afraid. So we have realised that Jacob Zuma has been idolised by some other people, he is a god to other people,” Maumela said. This comes after comments Madiba-Zuma made on social media where she suggested that Zuma would not go down without a fight. “He was prepared to pay the ultimate price. He will finish what he started,” part of the post said. The Zuma family later released a statement apologising the comments. However, Maumela said that they want the president to personally apologise for the statement that the first lady made. “We are urging President Zuma himself [to apologise]. We can’t find his son defending his mother and say this is not the statement of the family. We do not know until the husband responds.” -TNA Reporter
