Barclays Africa has on Thursday announced that it will no longer re-appoint auditing company KPMGas one of its auditors. The bank said it had previously committed to monitoring developments but the recent event the company found itself in with VBS Mutual Bank made matters worse. KPMG’s contract with Barclays will come to an end on May 31, 2018. The bank further said it has informed the Reserve Bank of the decision to cut ties with the auditing company. In their response to Barclay’s decision KPMG expressed its disappointment, adding that they fully accept the decision. “We are very proud of the work that we have performed for Barclays Africa Group over many years, and of the diligence and professionalism of the team who served them. “We have implemented far-reaching changes over the past seven months to all aspects of the firm including governance, quality, and risk management.” Barclays group is one of the biggest clients the company is doing business with. The group comes after companies such as Telkom, Wits University and the office of Auditor General. The company’s woes came after the leaked email, which stated that the company was responsible for auditing and approving shady deals for some Gupta linked companies. -Afro Reporter
