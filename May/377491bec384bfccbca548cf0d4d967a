Portfolio Committee on Communication has resolved to suspend Independent  Communication Authority (ICASA) Chairperson Rubben Mohlaloga. The committee said it has recommended to the National Assembly(NA) that Minister of Communication Nomvula Mokonyane suspend Mohlaloga after he was found guilty on charges of fraud and money laundering by the Commercial Commercial Court in Pretoria in January. According to the committee, the recommendation was in line with Section 8 of the Icasa Act. “Following the judgement in January, the committee initially took a resolution to recommend to the NA that Mr. Mohlaloga be removed from ICASA council, but the NA referred the matter back to the committee, following an intention to appeal,” the Committee said in a statement. The court found that Mohlaloga, and former Land Bank CEO Philemon Mohlahlane and others conspired and transferred R6 million from the bank account to an attorney’s trust account. According to the evidence presented in court, once the money was received, it was distributed to the men. The committee said it further resolved to fill the four board vacancies at the Media Diversity and Development Agency(MDDA). “The position will be advertised to call for public nomination” the statement continued. Committee Chairperson Humphrey Maxekwana said the committee was also briefed by the Content Advisor and Researcher on the summary of issues raised by labour unions during an oversight visit to the SABC. The committee is expected to meet the SABC board next week. -AfroVoice Reporter
