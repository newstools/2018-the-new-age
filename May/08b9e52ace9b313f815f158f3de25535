Minister of Public Service and Administration Ayanda Dlodlo, says the government is not going to renegotiate the public sector wage deal. Dlodlo said she hoped that the unions will come on board. This comes after the Public Service department offered a 7% increase, while mid and senior-level staff will receive 6.6% and 6% hikes, respectively. However, Deputy General Manager of Public Service Association (PSA) Tahir Maepa says they will not sign the agreement. Maepa said PSA will not be bullied by Cosatu. He accused Cosatu of not having interests of members at heart, claiming that the federations were trying to cosy up to the government. “In a dispute with (7)% increase, a three-year increase. The housing allowance won’t be increased to R1500. If we go on strike, all immigration officers will go on strike, will collapse the economy.” Meanwhile, Fedusa said it is now up to its members to consider government’s public service wage offer. The union said its focus was now to get a mandate from their members. “We know this agreement must be signed by 1 July. So for us, that is our teachers, our doctors, and nurses, to make a decision about the offer on the table.” -Afro Reporter
