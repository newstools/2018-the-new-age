MASILONYANA municipal mayor Notsizi Mochana has been recalled by the provincial committee of the ANC. She will leave the office next week Thursday. Speaking to Afro Voice yesterday afternoon, the ANC provincial deputy chairperson William Bulwane confirmed that they had recalled Mochana due to a long illness. He denied vehemently that they were recalling Mochana for poor performance.“We had to recall her as she has been ill for sometime. I am sure it has been more than six months. We decided to give her time to rest and take care of her health,” he said. “This is the only reason that we have recalled her, not because there were people who did not want her or because of the poor service delivery, there is no such,” Bulwane said. Recently, Brandfort residents went on a rampage shutting down the town demanding service delivery, including water, and for the mayor to step down. Bulwane said according to the resolution of the ruling party in Polokwane in 2007, the regions have to come up with three names and one of the names will be appointed mayor. “So far we have not yet started with the process but we will soon,” Bulwane said. A reliable source in Masilonyana said the mayor had been off work for months and had missed many council sittings. -BECKER SEMELA|beckers@afrotone.co.za
