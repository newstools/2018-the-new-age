FOLLOWING the death of a 27-year-old farm worker in Ventersdorp, Cosatu deputy general secretary Solly Phetoe has called for mass action against racism in the farming sector. Phetoe said exploitation of farm workers in the North West was rife and needed to be attended to. Albert Makgobe was allegedly run over by a bakkie by his employer and left unconscious without receiving medical attention. Makgobe died on his arrival at hospital and his family were informed by his colleagues last week. Phetoe said the department of labour and the police needed to zoom in more on the farming sector as workers were ill-treated. He said farmers in the province were operating outside the labour laws. “As Cosatu both in the province and nationally we will not rest until the rights of vulnerable communities are upheld,” Phetoe said. “There are workers who have worked here for 40 years without being registered, some were injured in the line of duty and were never compensated. “We are pleased that after our involvement the police have now opened a case against the suspect.” The Makgobe family spokesperson, Suzan Makgobe, said the family is still devastated by the incident. She said the family would want to see justice being done and other farm workers being protected from their employers. “The workers like my brother will not talk about their conditions because they fear losing their jobs, its up to us as community to stand up,” she said. The police in the North West have confirmed that a case of murder had been opened and investigations had began. tiisetsom@afrotone.co.za -TIISETSO MANOKO
