MYSTERY still surrounds the disappearance of a 22-year-old pregnant preschool teacher, Mbalenhle Mvungande, who is suspected to have been kidnapped. Mvungande from Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni went missing from Extension 28 last week Tuesday about 8.30am. Although her family has shared posts about her disappearance on social media, they said they were not comfortable with sharing details with the media as the case was “sensitive”. The family said pictures of the gagged Mvungande in what looks like a zinc shack were sent to them using her cell. However, when they send text messages to her phone they go unanswered. The Vosloorus police said they were investigating a case of kidnapping. This after the family showed them the pictures sent to them. Police spokesperson Capt Piet Rossouw said initially the police were investigating a case of a missing person after the family reported the case on Friday. “According to information we have, she was last seen at the house were she lives in Vosloorus,” Rossouw said. He said investigations were ongoing and at a sensitive stage. The Civilian Crime Intelligence Network (CCI Network) which has been involved in the search for Mvungande has called for a “digitally responsible engagement on social media” as the police continue to conduct their investigations. “We have been assured that the police are engaged in investigations around Mbali’s matter,” the CCI Network said. Those with information should contact Col Solly Phago on 082 822 7752 or Vosloorus police station on 011 724 1035/57. -LILLIAN SELAPISA|lillians@afrotone.co.za
