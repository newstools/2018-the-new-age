SEVEN of the eight suspects who were arrested in connection with the R3m bank robbery in Klerksdorp, will appear in the local magistrate’s court today for a formal bail application. The suspects appeared yesterday in the same court where arguments regarding their bail application were made. Charges against one of the arrested were withdrawn. Hawks North West spokesperson Capt Tlangelani Rikhotso said: “The charges have been dropped against one of the suspects who were arrested.” The suspects allegedly colluded and stole more than R3m from the local Nedbank branch in April, when two of the seven suspects posed as SBV security officers to do a routine pickup. They produced fake documents and were handed money by the bank staff. “Following the robbery, an intelligence-driven Hawks operation assisted by the Gauteng technical response team led to the arrest of Welcome Marcus, 50, and Charles Anthony Scheepers, 54, two weeks ago,” Rikhotso said. “On Sunday, the operation continued and led to the arrest of a further six people, two of whom are employed by the bank. “The Hawks priority crime specialised investigations unit is already conducting a financial and asset forfeiture probe on all the suspects.” -KEITUMETSI MOTLHALE|keitumetsim@afrotone.co.za
