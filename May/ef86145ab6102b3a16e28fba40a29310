The Democratic Alliance (DA) says that it welcomes a decision by the Presidency to abide by the North Gauteng High Court’s ruling on whether former president Jacob Zuma should be held personally liable for the legal fees related to his court cases. In March, the DA filed papers with the North Gauteng High Court requesting the court to set aside an agreement between the former President and the state to pay his legal costs. “as we have long held that the state should never have agreed to foot the bill for Mr Zuma’s legal fees,” reads a DA statement. The Presidency announced on Monday that it had agreed to abide by a ruling of the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria. “The Presidency has Monday, filed a notice in the Pretoria High Court to abide by the court’s decision on the application by the Democratic Alliance on the provision by the state of legal assistance to former President Jacob Zuma,” said the Presidency in a statement. The charges against the former President relate to crimes he allegedly committed in his personal capacity and not in his capacity as a then KwaZulu Natal MEC, deputy President or state President. “We now hope that the legal proceedings against Mr. Zuma will finally go ahead without any further unnecessary delays.  The resolution of this case will speed up the resumption of the criminal case,” said the DA. However, the Presidency added that it intended to submit an affidavit to further explain the matter. “The Presidency has indicated that it nevertheless intends to submit an explanatory affidavit to assist the court in understanding the history, legal basis, rationale and processes relating to the provision of this support,” -Afro Reporter
