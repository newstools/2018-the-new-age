The Auditor General (AG) Kimi Makwetu says that his 2016/17 audit findings reveal that there has been no positive change in municipality’s financials. Makwetu’s statements come after he revealed that irregular expenditure grew from R16 212 billion in 2015/16 to R28 376 billion in 2016/17. He said some of this irregular expenditure was incurred in previous years and only reported in 2016/17. “45 municipalities regressed in the year 2016-17 while only 16 improved. Most of these municipalities submitted poor quality financial statements and performance reports,” he said. The Eastern Cape came out at number one in the top 10 provinces which contributed to the irregular expenditure at R13 558 billion, followed by North West with the irregular expenditure of R4 284 billion in irregular expenditure. Gauteng is the third on the list with an irregular expenditure of R3 653 billion, KwaZulu-Natal at R2 449 billion and Mpumalanga at R1 996 billion. Makwetu said recommendations made by his office last year to ensure that the basics are in place to improve accountability did not receive attention from most of the municipalities, adding that his staff also experienced difficulties at some municipalities where they were intimidated while doing their job. The Auditor General was releasing the audit findings of the country’s 257 municipalities at Parliament on Wednesday. In what can be viewed as the harshest critique yet from the office of the Auditor-General he said the same accountability and governance challenges flagged over the years, persist. Out of all the 257 municipalities, Only 33 municipalities were able to produce quality financial statements. -Afro Voice Reporter
