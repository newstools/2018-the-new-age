A BUOYANT former president Jacob Zuma, who is due to appear in court to face corruption charges next week, has once again pleaded his innocence saying his conscious was clear. He said he had “done nothing wrong” during his tenure in government as he was raised in a religious family with “no criminals and (who) abhorred stealing”. Zuma was speaking in Nkandla where the National Interfaith Council of SA hosted a prayer to welcome him back home now that he has left the government. He said at times judges convicted people based on deceptive information provided to them but was quick to clarify that he was not attacking the judiciary. “That’s why at times judge’s verdicts are overturned by higher courts. This makes me fear nothing as I have no case to answer as I am no criminal.” Zuma told the receptive crowd of about 1000 people who included local ANC members, amakhosi (chiefs) and residents that contrary to recent reports, he had no intention of leaving the ANC to form another party. “Those who think that one day I will leave the ANC to join another party have no idea who I am. I will never do that.” But the leader of Mazibuye Emasisweni, Reggie Ngcobo, speaking on the sidelines of the prayer, said they had met with Zuma three times in recent days to “consult” with him about forming a party that will fight for radical economic transformation. The only high profile ANC leader at the prayer was the mayor of King Cetshwayo district municipality, Nonhle Mkhulisi. sihlem@afrotone.co.za
