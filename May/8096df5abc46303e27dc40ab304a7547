Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) Thandi Modise has urged members of the public to assist by providing information that could assist in the investigation of con artists defrauding people in her name. This comes after a scam emerged where fraudsters falsely using Modise’s name to request people to deposit large sums of money. In a statement, parliament says that Modise has seen various emails that falsely bear her name, requesting the receiver to transfer amounts of about R80 000 to an undisclosed account number. “In the emails, the writer claims that Ms Modise cannot take calls but is only available on email and promises to return the “loan” after a few days. We urge members of the public, who receive such emails, currently sent from modiset091@gmail.com, not to respond to these fabricated requests. Parliament has referred the scam to relevant security authorities for investigation,” reads the statement. Parliament urges members of the public not to respond to such fraudulent emails. “Anyone who has received such a letter or email is urged to come forward to assist with the investigations” Modise is not the only politician to recently be used as part of a money grab scheme. Earlier this month the Mangaung metro issued a warning to alert the public about a scam which was falsely using mayor Olly Mlamleli’s name. Fraudsters had asked people to assist her by depositing R75000 into a Capitec bank account. Minister of Public Service & Administration Ayanda Dlodlo’s name was also used as part of a scam to solicit R25 million through a purported contract on social media last year. -AfroVoice Reporter
