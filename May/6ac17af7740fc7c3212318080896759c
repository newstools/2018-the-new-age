THE ANC Women’s League yesterday entered the fray in the wake of assault allegations against ANC MP Mduduzi Manana. Manana is accused of having assaulted his domestic worker, who had filed charges against him, which were subsequently withdrawn. ANC Women’s League secretary general Meokgo Matuba insisted the league did not condone violence against women and urged the authorities to act harshly against the perpetrators of violence against women. “While we take into account the principle of innocent until proven guilty, the ANCWL is resolute in supporting the victims of violence and wishes to reiterate this position,” Matuba said. She urged community members to take a stand against the abuse of women and children. She expressed dismay at women who increasingly opted to withdraw cases filed with the police after they had been assaulted. “The ANCWL condemns violence against women and encourages all victims to report cases to law enforcement agencies and allow the law to take its course,” she said. Manana was previously sentenced to one year’s imprisonment or a R100000 fine after he assaulted three women at a restaurant in Fourways, Johannesburg, last year. He pleaded guilty to assaulting the women and was convicted on three counts of assault. Meanwhile, it emerged that Manana had filed a counter charge of extortion against his former domestic worker. -TIISETSO MANOKO|tiisetsom@afrotone.co.za
