Teenage double murder accused Zander Bylsma will remain behind bars until his next court appearance on 6 August after a brief appearance in the Vryburg Magistrate court on Monday. Bylsma made his first appearance following allegations that he murdered two Grade 11 pupils, aged 16 and 17 at the Stella High School near Vryburg after the pairs bodies were discovered in their hostel over the weekend. 19-year-old Bylsma who is believed to be a former boyfriend of the 16-year-old deceased
was arrested in connection with the murder. Provincial police spokesperson, LtCol Amanda Funani said the two girls, who were friends, shared a room and had asked the matron to leave the gate leading to their hostel unlocked on Friday evening. “They told the matron not to lock the gate because someone was bringing them clothes. It was not immediately clear if the clothes indeed came or how the accused got wind that the gate was not locked. However, investigations led the police to the former boyfriend of
one of the girls and he was arrested,” Funani said. The two did not turn up after the hostel bell was rung in the morning leading the matron to go to investigate. “The bodies of the two were discovered by the hostel matron. Firstly, the matron found the body of the 17-year-old girl hanging from the rails of the staircase in the hostel. She alerted the school management and the police were summoned,” Funani said. “Upon investigation, the police discovered the second body with a string around her neck in the hostel bathroom,” she said. The motive for the shocking deaths has yet to be confirmed. -AfroVoice Reporter
