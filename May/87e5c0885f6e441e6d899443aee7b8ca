ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule says the ruling party still needs more time in order to “further engage and consult ” before appointing a premier in the North West province to replace Supra Mahumapelo. Magashule made the comments during a press briefing on the outcomes of the ANC’s national executive committee (NEC) meeting held in Pretoria over the weekend. ” We did not conclude on the issue of North West and we have agreed that further engagements must take place and be done thoroughly but this matter will be resolved soon. ” We felt we needed more time to engage and we did not adequately engage on that item,” said Magashule. Previously the ANC had said its NEC would deliberate on three candidates for the position. On Tuesday Magashule said of the three names presented to the NEC they still felt that they needed more time to consult. “There is no truth to saying we have rejected anyone,” he said. Magashule’s comments came on the back of Mahumapelo’s resignation last week amid increasing allegations of corruption and maladministration in the provincial government. Over the weekend Magashule said that the North West ANC provincial executive committee (PEC) is still “intact” and will continue to be led by former premier Supra Mahumapelo. However, going into the meeting, Mahumapelo’s detractors felt his resignation as premier was not enough and wanted to disband the entire PEC. -AfroVoice Reporter
