FREE State premier Sisi Ntombela believes the newly built state of the art Busamed Bram Fischer International Airport hospital, that was officially opened at the N8 corridor, would absorb a significant number of the returning doctors who would be completing their studies in Cuba. Many of the crop of doctors are expected back in the province in June. “The Free State will be welcoming more than 117 doctors from Cuba and we have called on Busamed to absorb a substantial number of them upon their arrival in the country next month,” she said. Ntombela said they were particularly excited about the return of doctors and said they would contribute enormously to the health system in the province. “We are excited about some of the returning students who will come to work here as part of the agreement we had with them when they left, we are really excited about these developments. “What a coincidence that we are opening a brand new airport hospital at the time that they are returning home,” she said. Ntombela said what pleased her the most was the fact that the hospital had created a significant number of jobs in the province. A total of 150 people have been employed as permanent staff of the hospital. “During the construction phase, Busamed created more than 300 temporary job opportunities and 150 permanent jobs, a major contribution to the economy of the Mangaung metro that is indeed great news for the economy of the province,” she said. Ntombela said it was their duty as the provincial government to make sure they create employment opportunities for the people of the province. Busamed hospital is a black owned organisation which plays a fundamental role in lifting the health standards in the province. The hospital is a paperless establishment world-class digital technology which fosters efficiency and effectiveness. michaelt@afrotone.co.za -MICHAEL TLHAKUDI
