Hundreds of jazz fans are expected to gather at Mamelodi Community Hall to pay their tributes to the late jazz great Philip Nchipi Tabane. The 84-year-old passed away on Friday morning at Mamelodi hospital in Pretoria after a short illness. His funeral will take place on Saturday in Mamelodi. The legendary jazz maestro and his band Malombo are credited as the founders of the brand of jazz called Malombo which they founded in the 70s. Tabane is known for his liveliness on stage when he played some of his memorable chart-toppers like Nkupi, Keabereka, Muvhango, and Phamphamadiba to name a few that remain favourites for his legions of fans years after their release. His music is played widely in between scenes of SABC2 soapie Muvhango. The multi-award winner was also bestowed with two honorary doctorates in music by University of Venda in 1998 and University of KwaZulu-Natal in 2015. -Afro Voice Reporter
