The acting mayor of the city of Cape Town, Ian Neilson, said today that if the Western Cape High Court had not ruled on Patricia De Lille’s urgent application by Monday afternoon he would proceed to appoint a new mayoral committee in the city. On Friday, the high court reserved Judgement on De Lille’s battle to retain her mayoral position and did not indicate when the ruling would be delivered. “I am advised that, legally, nothing precludes me from proceeding with the appointment of a mayoral committee but out of the respect of the court I will delay making that appointment until 3pm tomorrow, May 14. “If by then the Western Cape High Court has not ruled on De Lille’s application … I  will proceed with the appointing of a new mayoral committee,” Neilson’s statement said. De Lille took the DA to court after she was stripped of her membership of the party last week. She is accused of bringing the party into disrepute, as well as breaching the conditions of her suspension. The DA initially intended to remove her by using the party’s recently adopted “recall” clause. The party is now using section 3.5.1.2 of its constitution to get rid of De Lille citing that she had made public declarations about her intention to resign from the party, which is against its rules. The DA cited a radio interview on Radio 702 where it claims she alluded twice that she intended to resign from the political party as soon as she “had cleared her name”. The acting mayor says that he will convene a mayoral committee meeting on Tuesday. -Afro Reporter
