ANC Deputy Secretary-General Jesse Duarte has dismissed allegations that party members who supported Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma’s candidacy for the presidency were regrouping and planning a takeover. Duarte said all ANC leaders had a duty to support the leadership that was elected during the elective conference in December. She was speaking at a media conference where North West Premier and ANC Chairperson in the province Supra Mahumapelo announced an early retirement from the position of Premier. Mahumapelo has been under pressure to resign as a Premier following allegations of corruption and mismanagement in the province. “Yes we all had preferences for the party presidency in December, yes some of our preferences were not supported by the majority of the conference. These accusations that those who had certain preferences were mobilising against the elected leadership is neither here nor there,” Duarte said. She said the current leadership under Ramaphosa will be in place for the next five years and it is a duty for every ANC member to support it. -Afro Voice Reporter
