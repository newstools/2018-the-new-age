Portfolio Committee on Sports has called on MultiChoice to quickly investigate the reasons why Bok legend Ashwin Willemse walked off a set when he was analysing a match between Lions and Brumbies with another Bok legend Naas Botha and former Springbok coach Nick Mallet which the Lions won by 42-24. Before putting down his papers and leaving the set, Willemse stated on live TV that he will not tolerate being patronised by people who only played Rugby during the apartheid era. He also complained that during his playing days, he had been categorised as a quota player all his life, when he, in fact, had been the best wing of his generation. Committee Chairperson Beauty Dlulane said the incident was concerning and should be addressed speedily as it had invoked much emotion, and that the committee condemned racism in all its manifestation as it had the potential to polarise society. “South Africans should be circumspect in commenting on this matter and should allow the investigation to proceed and reach a conclusion. As things are, everyone is venturing an opinion about a matter on which we lack details.” He said South Africans needed to accept that differences of opinion during sports analysis is inevitable and is the reason a panel discussion is constituted. “This incident better be about that, and that only,” Dlulane said. She said if indeed it is found that the incident had anything to do with racial discrimination as Willemse alleges, MultiChoice has a duty to do what is necessary as per its code of conduct that regulates the behaviour of guests analysts. Multichoice CEO Calvo Mawela said the sports channel will take an appropriate action upon the conclusion of its investigation. “SuperSport has taken note of the strong public sentiment and we take this matter seriously. “Whatever the findings, appropriate action will be taken to remedy the situation,” Mawela said in a statement. -Afro Reporter
