Parliament has reached a settlement between its former head of protection services Zelda Holtzman. Parliament will be paying Holtzman eight months salary after it agreed to withdraw all charges against her and reversing its decision to dismiss her. Holtzman agreed to withdraw the dispute she had lodged with the Commision for Concilliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) after her dismissal from parliament in 2017. She was fired from parliament after being found guilty of several charges, which according to parliament spokesperson Moloto Mothapo included failure to produce a strategic business plan in line with and in support of parliament’s strategic plan and to submit an annual budget. Holtzman disputed her dismissal and referred the matter to the CCMA. Mothapo said the settlement reached between parliament and Holtzman also ends her employment by parliament. “Today’s agreement brings the long, drawn-out dispute to an end and also ends any relationship between Parliament and Ms. Holtzman,” he said. Holtzman has maintained that she was being victimised for blowing the whistle on alleged wrongdoing at parliament. -Afro Reporter
