The Durban Regional Court has postponed the case of against the 23-year-old man accused of murdering 21-year-old Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) student Zolile Khumalo to May 10 for further investigation. The suspect is charged with murder and being in possession of an unlicensed gun and ammunition. The man gunned down Khumalo at her residence in the Durban city centre on Tuesday night. It is believed the pair were dating and that the deceased was planning on dumping him. At the same time, the South African Student Congress (SASCO) expressed its disbelief by the suspect gesture during court proceedings in court. “As an organisation, we are extremely angry that the perpetrator of women abuse signaled a gun sign of pulling a trigger inside the court, this shows the level of arrogance and that he has no remorse.” Sasco also pleaded with all students to continue the fight until justice is served. Early the organisation had lead students to a march to the Durban Regional Court in a bid to call to a judge not to grant the suspected murder a bail. During student’s demonstration, student leader lambasted campus security’s clumsiness for having to allow someone who was armed to gain entry at the campus. At the same time, minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Lindiwe Sisulu also condemned the brutal killing of a 21-year-old student. Sisulu described Khumalo as someone who had bright future ahead of her. “I feel deep sympathy for her parents, family and friends, it is painful and very sad. We must do more to protect women from being murdered by partners or former partners. “We trust that the judicial system will take necessary steps and send a clear message to perpetrators that South Africans are tired of such senseless killings will not tolerate them,” Sisulu said. -Afro Reporter
