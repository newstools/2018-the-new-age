Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Brilliant Khuzwayo has decided to leave the club when his contract with Amakhosi expires in June. Chiefs football manager Bobby Motaung has explained the reason why the 28-year-old shot-stopper is leaving the club after spending six years at Naturena. “Brilliant Khuzwayo approached the club asking for a blessing to move to another club at the end of the current season,” Motaung said in a club statement. “Brilliant gave us his all and we’ve given him our support throughout his stay with us,” adds Motaung. “When a player has been good to the club and asks to spread his wings, we have to respect his wish. Khuzwayo announced his departure from Chiefs after their 2-1 win against Ajax Cape Town following the last match of the Absa Premiership season. However, Khuzwayo did not say which team he will be joining in the 2018/19 season.  Fare the well Nhlanhla!!!! A message from @Brilliekhuzwayo to the Chairman, Football Manager and especially to you the supporters #KCOneTeam #ThankYouBrilliant pic.twitter.com/hwtcvIeTMy — Kaizer Chiefs (@KaizerChiefs) May 12, 2018  -AfroVoice Reporter
