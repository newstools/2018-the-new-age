The case against embattled Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille has been moved to June. De Lille was granted an interim relief by the Western Cape High Court to return as the Mayor of Cape Town after the DA announced the cessation of her membership. Judge Pat Gamble ruled that her membership termination is suspended. The full case was scheduled to be heard on Friday, May 25. My court case which was scheduled for this Friday, May 25 has been postponed to the 4 and 5 June because the judges need more time to prepare — Patricia de Lille (@PatriciaDeLille) May 23, 2018  The Mayor took the DA to court following its Federal Executives’ announcement earlier this month that her membership from the party has been ceased. The party is accusing her of repeatedly breaching the Code of Conduct for councillors as well as the Constitution of the DA, for bringing the party into disrepute and breaching the conditions of her suspension. The DA turned to section 3.5.1.2 of its constitution to get rid of De Lille citing that she had made public declarations about her intention to resign from the party, which is against party rules. -Afro Voice Reporter
