The ANC parliamentary caucus has congratulated its members of parliament who were sworn in as members of the Pan African Parliament (PAP) today. Earlier today, National Council of Provinces Chairperson Thandi Modise,  iNkosi Zwelivelile Mandla Mandela, Thoko Didiza, and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema were sworn in as members, replacing Hunadi Mateme, Thandi Memela, and Charles Nqakula. The PAP is made up of 255 members who represent 55 African Union member states that have ratified the protocol for its establishment. ANC caucus spokesperson Nonceba Mhlauli, said that the Parliament is intended as a platform for people from all African states to be involved in discussions and decision-making on the problems and challenges facing the continent. “The ANC has full confidence that our deployees will represent the South African Parliament and the people it represents, with the necessary vigour and commitment at this important institution for the development of the African people,” Mhlauli said. -Afro Reporter
