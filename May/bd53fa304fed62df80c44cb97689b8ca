SUNDOWNS coach Pitso Mosimane has accused Wydad goalkeeper Yassine el Kharroubi of being a “time killer” following the 1-1 draw played in the Lucas Moribe Stadium, near Pretoria. One El Kharroubi trick was to advance from his box seemingly to take a free-kick, then change his mind and leave the task to a slow-moving teammate, wasting close to a minute. Meanwhile, South African Phakamani Mahlambi failed to take advantage of a rare start for record eight-time champions Al Ahly as they were held 0-0 at home by Esperance of Tunisia. Injuries to Moroccan Walid Azaro and Nigerian Junior Ajayi opened the door for Mahlambi. -AFRO VOICE REPORTER|sports@afrotone.co.za
