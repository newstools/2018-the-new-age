The DA says that a lack of intervention by the South African government to stop an attempt to undermine constitutional democracy in Burundi is concerning. This follows reports that Burundians have voted in a referendum on constitutional reforms that, if passed, will shore up the power of President Pierre Nkurunziza and enable him to rule until 2034. Reports said that the police and soldiers were out in force for the referendum, which comes three years after Nkurunziza sought a controversial third term, triggering a political crisis that has killed 1,200 and forced 400,000 from their homes. The party’s shadow minister of international relations and corporations, Stevens Mokgalapa said that the DA stands behind the people of Burundi and makes an appeal to all stakeholders that the will of the people be respected. “The DA is heartened by reports of the people of Burundi turning out to exercise their democratic rights to vote in the referendum. “They do this despite the intimidation and harassment in the last months leading up to the referendum because they believe in the vision of the Arusha Peace Accords of a peaceful and democratic Burundi.” He said that the DA asks that the will of the people be respected and that the government of South Africa take a stand to protect democracy on the African continent. -Afro Reporter
