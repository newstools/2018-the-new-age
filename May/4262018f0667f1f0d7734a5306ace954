Police Minister Bheki Cele will on Tuesday visit a scene where an ANC member was shot dead on Monday in KwaZulu-Natal. ANC branch treasurer for the South Coast, Sifiso Cele was killed at his home in Margate in front of his family. Cele’s killing is the second in 2018 in the Lower South Coast region. Nombuso Mqadi who was a member of the Ward 5 branch in Umzumbe was also killed at her home in Frankland by unknown assailants in April. Although the reason for Cele’s killing is not yet known, it is understood that he was killed in front of his wife and two children. It is reported that two men entered Cele’s home in Margate and demanded cell phones from his family before taking him to another room where he was allegedly fatally shot four times before fleeing the crime scene. Police Spokesperson Gerald Mfeka said at this stage they have not yet identified the perpetrators. “No one has been arrested for the death of Mr. Cele, but our investigations are continuing,” said Mfeka. He also could not say with certainty whether Cele and the Police Minister were related. He said the Minister will be visiting Cele’s family to get first-hand information regarding what happened and also to see the crime scene. -Afro Reporter
