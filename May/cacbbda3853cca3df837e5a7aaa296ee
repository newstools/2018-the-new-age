President Cyril Ramaphosa has on Wednesday announced that he will be contributing half of his presidential salary to help small social projects across the country. Ramaphosa made the announcement while presenting the Presidency Budget Vote in the National Assembly. Ramaphosa announced that the contribution will be known as the “Nelson Mandela Thuma Mina Fund” which will be managed by the Nelson Mandela Foundation and is set to be launched on the 18th of July to mark the 100th anniversary of Madiba’s birth. Ramaphosa called on other leaders as well as citizens who are able to follow his example and make whatever contributions they can to the fund. Last year the Independent Commission for the Remuneration of Public Office Bearers recommended a 4% salary increment which saw former President Jacob Zuma’s annual salary rise to R2.9m per annum. This is not the first time that a sitting President has donated his salary towards a charitable cause. Former President Nelson Mandela also famously cut his presidential salary and also donated a third of his salary as a regular donation to his own children’s fund. -Afro Voice Reporter
