City of Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille has until 3 pm today to convince the DA’s Federal Executive why she should not be removed as the city’s mayor. Should the Federal Executive not accept her reasons for keeping the job, she would be given 48 hours to resign from her post, failure to do so will result in the party cancelling her membership. This comes after the party’s caucus in the city voted in a secret ballot, in favour of her removal. De Lille has for a long time been at loggerheads with the DA leadership over governance of the city and accusations of corruption against her. During the party’s Federal Congress last month, the party introduced a clause that makes it easier for it to remove elected officials from their positions once it loses confidence in them. De Lille has always maintained that the clause was aimed at removing her. She said she was ready to make her submissions to the party and has always been prepared to subject herself to the party’s internal process. De Lille said she did not understand why the party was in such a rush to remove her and not waiting for the conclusion of a disciplinary hearing that it instituted against her. “All I am saying is I am entitled to be submitted to a due process. I am entitled to natural justice, I fought for these rights that are in our constitution,” De Lille told the SABC. -Afro Reporter
