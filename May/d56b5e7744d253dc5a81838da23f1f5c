Member of the African National Congress (ANC) national executive committee Zizi Kodwa says that the latest fallout between the DA and Cape Town mayor Patricia De Lille is an indication of a ‘real implosion’ that is sure to come in the party. Kodwa was speaking in the Western Cape on Wednesday morning following the DA’s decision to rescind the Cape Town Mayor’s party membership. “The wheels are coming off, what we see and what we saw happening with Patricia De Lille is a beginning. There is a lot that is yet to come. A real implosion of the DA is coming and I think that implosion amongst others signifies the fact that there has been a lot of unhappiness about many people at the DA but their views is a descending voice that has been submerged,” he said. Speaking during the press conference, Kodwa said that the ANC would not allow the internal strife within the DA affect service delivery due to a party that was ‘mutilating itself somewhere’ The ANC in the Western Cape added that it is displeased with the DA’s decision to cease De Lille’s party membership. “Let’s allow the DA to mutilate itself outside, not use the City itself to make sure it damages the prospects of poor people who are looking up to a democratically elected local government for their better future,” ” I think for today is a lesson particularly for DA that the false impression they have created all along for the longest time about themselves is coming back to haunt them,” Kodwa said. Kodwa said that the ANC had a responsibility to govern with ‘loyalty and trust’ and shall remain the hope of the people of Cape Town. -Afro Reporter
