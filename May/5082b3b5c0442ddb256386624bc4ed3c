The DA in Limpopo said it would write to the Health Ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba to ask him to urgently investigate the circumstances that led to the death of a woman who was hospitalised following a leg injury. 48-year-old Granny Madikwe from Mokopane was admitted at Voortrekker Hospital in Mokopane after she was run over by a taxi on 29 March before she died, according to DA because of not being given a sufficient medical help. DA Health spokesperson Langa Bodlani said after being in the hospital for weeks without help, Madikwe asked the party to help. Bodlani said as soon as they became aware on Madikwa’s plight, the party immediately contacted Head of Department of Health in the province Dr Ntsie Kgapole, who on more than one occasion in writing promised to attend to the incident. “However, when I went to visit Ms Madikwe on 17 April, she had still not received any medical help. “The doctor I spoke to told me that he was extremely concerned that the longer she was kept without the necessary care, her bones would be healing although not in their natural alignment.” Bodlani said this meant that if she was to be operated on eventually, she would have her bone structure broken again in order to align it properly. He said Madikwe’s ordeal at the hands of the hospital and her subsequent passing was grossly uncaring, negligent and cruel and called for the health department to bow its head in shame. “I also call on the Limpopo Health MEC, Dr Phophi Ramathuba, to publicly account for what happened here. “She must explain to the people of this province how it can be that after her department was made aware of the situation, they continued to drag their feet.” Attempts to get a comment from Limpopo Department of Health were unsuccessful. -Afro Reporter
