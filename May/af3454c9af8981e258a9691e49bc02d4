The Bloemfontein Magistrates Court has on Friday granted a request by Varun Gupta to have his current bail conditions relaxed and allow him to travel to India in order to attend a religious ceremony. Gupta, one of the accused in the Estina Dairy farm scandal, approached the court seeking permission to go to India and to fly from OR Tambo to New Delhi. Back in February, he was among eight suspects who were arrested in connection with the project and were released on bail ranging from R10 000 to R200 000. On Friday, Magistrate Merlene Greyvenstein granted Gupta request which will allow him to obtain his passport from the investigating Hawks officer in the case. As per the order, Gupta will be allowed to leave South Africa today and is expected back in the country on or no later than 27 May. “The applicant is to return his passport to the investigating officer within 24 hours of his return to the Republic of South Africa,” said Greyvenstein. The Gupta family and their associates are alleged to have benefitted from the controversial dairy project through their company Estina, which allegedly syphoned off more than R200m meant to benefit emerging black farmers in Vrede. Only R2m has apparently been spent on the farm. -Afro Reporter
