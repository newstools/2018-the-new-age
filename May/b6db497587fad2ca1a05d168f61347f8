HEALTH and safety at mines remain a key area of concern which requires a consistent priority, says Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe. He was delivering his maiden budget vote in Parliament for his department, worth R1.9bn. Mantashe said the incident that took place in Sibanye-Stillwater where six workers lost their lives should compel the regulator, business and organised labour to step up efforts in promoting health and safety. “The long-term sustainability of mining is dependent not only on its growth , competitiveness and transformation but also on how well its workforce is cared for and safe,” he said. Mantashe said his department was paying special attention to the issue of seismicity. It could not be business as usual when over 20 miners have died already this year, he said. “We will be hosting a health and safety summit to access progress made in attaining our objective of zero harm and chart a new way forward,” he said. Mantashe said the mining sector continued to be the main economic driver in the country with more than 460 000 personnel employed in the sector. However, the minister said issuing of licences was one of the biggest challenges the department was faced with. “This aspect of our work is fraught with greater challenges and laced with corruption, from declined prospecting rights, unprocessed applications and unexplained red tape,” he said. Mantashe said 50% of the departmental budget was going to go to the state-owned entities. “An insufficient allocation of resources curtails our efforts to create more economic opportunities in our communities,” he said. Mantashe said he was mindful of the country’s fiscal constraints as the department was striving to ensure that it would afford various communities without licences an opportunity to mine. -TIISETSO MANOKO|tiisetsom@afrotone.co.za
