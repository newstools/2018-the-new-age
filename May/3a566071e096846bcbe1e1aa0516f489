The race to see which local artist will walk away with the bragging rights of having their song crowned as record of the year at the 24th South African Music awards (Samas) has officially started – with campaigns pushing several artists already in full swing. Music fans would remember when rapper AKA, after blasting the awards event earlier this year in the heat of the moment – before changing his tune when he found out that two of his songs, Don’t Forget To Pray and The World Is Yours, made it onto the list, urging fans to ignore his earlier tweet about not campaigning. “Oh s***, World is Yours & Don’t Forget to Pray both made it to the top 10 finalists for the record of the year category at the Samas …. y’all ignored the s*** out of those tweets, huh?! “Thank you. We might just campaign after all,” the rapper excitedly tweeted. Tied with him in the top spot is Kwesta with anthems Spirit and Ngiyaz’fela Ngawe, featuring Thabsie. Lady Zamar who has provided countless dance hits such as My Baby, is also in the running – alongside the likes of Distruction Boyz with Omunye, I Do by LaSauce featuring Amanda, Suited by Shekhinah. The list was revealed on SABC1’s music show Live Amp at the weekend. –Nontokozo Gxumisa
