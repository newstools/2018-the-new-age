The South African Local Government Association (Salga) says municipalities must have tighter internal control mechanisms and consequence management for how public resources are spent. Salga said the fact that 257 municipalities in the country have regressed for the 2016-17 financial year was of great concern. “The ongoing Municipal Audit Support Program must be intensified to improve accountability for defaulting municipalities,” the organisation said. According to Salga’s Executive Director Simphiwe Dzengwa Municipal, Audit Support Program will help municipalities that obtained adverse audit opinions and those with audits that were not finalized by the legislated deadline. The organisation further said it is committed to continue working with all key stakeholders, such COGTA, National and Provincial Treasuries, as well as municipalities, to intensify audit support interventions for troubled municipalities. On Tuesday, Auditor General Kimi Makwetu revealed that there has been no positive change in municipality’s financials. Makwetu said some of this irregular expenditure was incurred in previous years and only reported in 2016/17. “45 municipalities regressed in the year 2016-17 while only 16 improved. Most of these municipalities submitted poor quality financial statements and performance reports,” he said. The Eastern Cape came out at number one in the top 10 provinces which contributed to the irregular expenditure at R13 558 billion, followed by North West with the irregular expenditure of R4 284 billion in irregular expenditure. Gauteng is the third on the list with an irregular expenditure of R3 653 billion, KwaZulu-Natal at R2 449 billion and Mpumalanga at R1 996 billion. -Afro Voice Reporter
