THE site where the burnt body of Karabo Mokoena was dumped in Lyndhurst, Johannesburg, by her ex-boyfriend Sandile Mantsoe, has been earmarked for development, Ward 81 councillor Irene Rugheimer said at a public meeting in Lyndhurst. “We are looking at cleaning the site, putting up a light and refurbishing the space to prevent more crime. We will try to get a sponsor to help us beautify the area and make it a special place,” she said. Mokoena was murdered in April last year and her body was dumped on the site before being set alight. Sandile Mantsoe was sentenced to 32 years in jail earlier this month in the South Gauteng High Court. A foundation to help abused women and children in Gauteng has since been established in the name of Mokoena. The Karabo Mokoena Foundation was officially launched last year following her gruesome murder that was highly publicised on various media platforms. Foundation director, Hilary Leong, said: “The mission is to advocate for women and children’s rights, empowerment and also to facilitate social action against abuse at a grass roots level to bring about positive changes.” The Karabo Mokoena Foundation was initiated by concerned people driven by a strong passion and desire to create change and give hope to individuals and communities affected by violence against women and children, children and women trafficking and poverty. kutullom@afrotone.co.za -KUTULLO MADISHA
