Police are maintaining a strong presence on the N3 Highway in Mooi River toll plaza following a violent protest by community members in the area on Sunday night. 54 people have so far appeared in court after they were arrested in connection with the torching. Both north and southbound carriageways have now all been cleared after being closed down for hours as the police were busy with mop-up operations on the highway. According to KwaZulu-Natal Police Spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele, the truck drivers were protesting against the hiring of foreign nationals as truck drivers. On Monday, KwaZulu-Natal MEC of Transport Mxolisi Kaunda visited the are and commended the police for the swift way they had dealt with the protesters. Kaunda said he welcomed the fact that the truck drivers were involved in a labour matter but could not bring himself to understanding why people had to resort to such barbarism to put their point across. “Now the investors who may have wanted to invest in this area may now be hesitant because of this barbarism. We are urging community members to distance themselves from this. He said those who were arrested with goods that were looted from the trucks should face the music as the provincial government had no sympathy with people who loot. -Afro Worldview
