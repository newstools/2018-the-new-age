Former president Jacob Zuma has pledged to continue to fund needy students through the JG Zuma Foundation. Zuma said he would help needy students because he truly believed in education as an economic and mental liberator of all. He was speaking at the Hlengimpilo Full Service School in Inanda, Durban, where the school was celebrating being national runners-up at Basic Education Department’s Excellence and Africa Day competition. “The foundation will continue to help needy students across the country. Soon I will be back here with the foundation’s executive to meet with the school’s authorities to find ways we can help needy pupils get an education,” Zuma said. He said he wanted to see the school become one of the best public schools in the country. “From now onwards, this school is going to be like my baby. I want to help it to grow to be one of the best schools in the country and see it conquer,” Zuma said. Zuma said parents should ensure that their kids attended school. The school’s principal, Simphiwe Mpungose, said they were looking at partnerships with Zimbabwean schools to tap into their formula of success in subjects such as mathematics and science. “We are aiming for the first spot in the next competition as we believe we can do better. We hope our proposed partnership with Zimbabwean schools will help us achieve that dream,” Mpungose said. sihlem@afrotone.co.za
