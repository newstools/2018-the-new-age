CITY of Tshwane mayor Solly Msinga will this morning conduct an oversight visit to assess progress at the city’s Hopeline call centre at Sediba Hope Offices in Pretoria. This centre was officially launched in September 2017 in conjunction with the member of the mayoral committee for health and 23 NPOs to help members of the community. Along with the call centre, a drug and substance abuse line was established to offer a lifeline to drug users through an integrated approach. Hopeline is one of the interventions by the city to fight the scourge of drug and substance abuse and offers assistance with information and support. Spokesperson Samkelo Mgobozi said the city aimed to reduce substance abuse and its harmful consequences by giving users and their families the opportunity to get assistance through referrals to rehabilitation services and counselling and enabling the communities to anonymously report drug peddlers. Furthermore, it aims to link people with other support relevant to the kind of assistance required. The city is also known for the high usage of nyaope used in the method called “bluetooth” which has gripped the youth in the city. -KEITUMETSI MOTLHALE|keitumetsim@afrotone.co.za
