President Cyril Ramaphosa’s clean up of the South African Revenue Service (Sars) seems to be gathering even more momentum following his announcement that he has established a commission of inquiry into tax administration and governance. Speaking during the Presidency Budget Vote in the National Assembly on Wednesday, Ramaphosa said that the commission will be chaired by former Judge Robert Nugent who will be assisted by Mr Michael Katz, alongside Adv Mabongi Masilo and Mr Vuyo Kahla. “The terms of reference for the commission will be gazetted in the coming days,” he said. The announcement comes just a day after the President announced the replacement of Judge Kate O’Regan and the appoint of Azhar Bham as the new presiding officer for the inquiry into disciplinary charges against suspended SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane. The Presidency said the decision was taken after Moyane raised an objection based on a link between Judge Kate O’Regan and Corruption Watch, an NGO of which she is a board member. Moyane is facing charges of misconduct in terms of the Revenue Service Act, the Public Finance Management Act and the SARS code of conduct have been making headlines. Meanwhile the President also announced that he was in the process of appointing a review panel to examine the structure and operational capabilities of the State Security Agency. During his speech the President also announced that he will be contributing half of his presidential salary to help small social projects across the country. -Afro Voice Reporter
