MultiChoice CEO Calvo Mawela has on Monday responded to the incident that happened on Saturday at SuperSport studios where Ashwin Willemse walked out of a live broadcast. Willemse was analysing a match between Lions and Brumbies when he accused his fellow analysts Nick Mallett and Naas Botha of patronising him. Mawela said the three analysts were friendly to each other during the discussion he had with them.  “What is encouraging about the discussion we had is that Nick, Naas and Ashwin were part of the discussion. They were all in the same room and were cautious to each other. They shook hands, they openly chat. There’s no anormosity that exist between the three of them from what we have seen,” said Mawela. Mawela said they could not pick up racial discrimination in the discussion they had with Nick, Naas and Ashwin but promised to investigate further. “From the observation of today’s discussion, there’s no racism that we picked up from any of the discussion we have had. We do not see it anywhere in the discussion we have had today. “So as far as we are concerned its people that go into something of some sort but we are still digging deeper, getting to the underneath… what really happened and what transpired to lead to this type of action because nobody walks off stage just for just for the sake of walking off stage. There must be something deeper and we are saying we are engaging all parties to get to the bottom of this,” said Mawela. -Afro Reporter
