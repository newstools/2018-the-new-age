The inter-ministerial team is expected to make an announcement about its findings regarding embattled North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo after presenting its report to President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday. Minister in the Presidency Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who was part of the team tasked by the President to go on a fact-finding mission in the North West, says that they will first give the report on their findings to Ramaphosa before making any pronouncements. “We were asked to come here [North West] by Cabinet and the President, so they should be the first ones to get a report from us before we speak to you about our findings,” Dlamini-Zuma said. The team engaged with different sectors in the province and is expected to end its mission this week. “We have spent a week here with both the technical team and the inter-ministerial team. Last week we were seeing more of the government structures. Today [Monday] we will continue with the government structures but we also see its stakeholders. After that we will do a preliminary report to cabinet and to the President on Wednesday,” said Dlamini-Zuma. Pressure has mounted on the ANC to act on Mahumapelo following weeks of protest calling for him to step down. He is alleged to be involved in corrupt activities in the province. Meanwhile the opposition in the province, the Economic Freedom Fighters has also tabled a for a motion of no confidence against Mahumapelo. A council sitting that was previously scheduled to table a motion of no confidence against Mahumapelo was been postponed last month. The EFF in the province had approached the courts for the motion against the Premier to be conducted through a secret ballot. -Afro Reporter
