North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo has urged his supporters to be patient and allow the ongoing Provincial Executive (PEC) meeting, which is set to decide his fate to conclude and not disrupt the meeting. This comes after reports that some pro-Supra supporters tried to storm the meeting venue on Wednesday. “I am requesting you give us the opportunity for me to address the PEC, and then the whole PEC will address you,” Mahumapelo said. The embattled Premier reminded his supporters that he was still chairperson of the ANC in the province until 2019. “I know there are some people making noises about our PEC, I will talk more about that when the meeting is done. Please allow the PEC to happen, then you’re chairperson will talk to you,” he said. Earlier in the day, Mahumapelo had told the media that there was a hatched plot by opposition parties to have him removed from office. There was rife speculation that Mahumapelo will officially announce his resignation on Wednesday. He, however, said the PEC had asked him to wait for the outcome of the meeting which is currently underway before making any announcements about his future. In the past month, the province’s capital Mahikeng and surrounding areas saw violent protests with residents accusing Mahumapelo of corruption and calling for him to vacate his position as premier. -Afro Worldview Reporter
