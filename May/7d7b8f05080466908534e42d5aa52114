 Petrus Nkosi appeared at the Nelspruit Magistrates court on Monday where he was released on R8 000 bail. He faced charges of conspiracy to commit cash in transit robbery, armed robbery, money laundering, defeating the ends of justice and unauthorised use of a state vehicle. Nkosi, who is a Warrant Officer attached to the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation Unit was arrested after he was accused of conspiring with a cash heist syndicate, which allegedly resulted in a bank robbery and a cash heist in Hazyview in Mpumalanga in 2015. Hawks spokesperson in Mpumalanga Dineo Sekgotodi said their investigations indicated that Nkosi’s relative withdrew money on his behalf at retail stores. “Our investigations linked him (Nkosi) to the syndicates through money market transactions where his relative allegedly withdrew money on his behalf,” Sekgotodi said. Sekgotodi said at this stage, the police investigations were continuing and she could not say how many more people are still going to be charged with Nkosi. “That will be determined in court,” she said. -Afro Worldview
