The Democratic Alliance (DA) has accused the Gauteng government of covering up the backlog in cancer treatment at two of the province’s hospitals which are the only ones that can offer radiation treatment in the Province. DA Shadow MEC of Health in Gauteng Jack Bloom, said he has on numerous times asked for the numbers on the waiting lists and the waiting times for cancer treatment at the Steve Biko Academic Hospital in Pretoria and Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital in Johannesburg in the provincial legislature but tMEC of Health Gwen Ramokgopa responded in each case that it “varies from month to month” or “variable periodically”. Over the weekend, The Sunday Times reported that patients could wait up to four months to receive cancer treatment, which several doctors referred to as “extreme and unacceptable”. The newspaper also said there were currently 500 patients on the waiting list for radiation treatment at Charlotte Maxeke, while at Steve Biko there was a shortage of six Radiographers and three Medical Oncology Specialists. Bloom said Ramokgopa in her written reply said there was a scarcity of experts in the field of oncology and that the department could not keep up with high inflation of health technology and medicines that the department’s budget could not keep up with. “It is unacceptable that Ramokgopa refuses to give proper figures for cancer waiting lists and waiting times. “As pointed out by Justice Dikgang Moseneke in the Life Esidimeni arbitration, the MEC is constitutionally obliged to provide accurate information to the Legislature, unlike former Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu who gave false information to my questions on Esidimeni,” Bloom said. He said he was fearful that the lives of cancer patients could be at risk because of long waiting times for radiation treatment and the department refuses to acknowledge the problem instead of tackling it. -Afro Reporter
