Portfolio Committee on Higher Education has called on all stakeholders involved in the higher education sector to work collectively in order to ensure that the funding system for tertiary students is improved and developed. The committee said it was in agreement with Higher Education Minister Naledi Pandor that the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (Nsfas) systems and capacity should be improved to benefit students before the resumption of the 2019 academic year. Committee Chairperson Connie September said the committee is concerned about the challenges that had been raised over a period of time with stakeholders resulting from the central applications process and the piloting of the student centred model. There have been complaints about the late payment to tertiary institutions and payments of students meal allowances by Nsfas. The committee was also briefed by Nsfas and Universities SA on challenges they have been encountering following the introduction of fee-free dispensation for poor students. “The system is designed to benefit students, and we expect no less. “The delays in payments being made to institutions should be dealt with expeditiously, we cannot have students waiting for meal and book allowances for longer than five months,” September said. September said Nsfas need to kickstart a process of redesigning the student-centred funding model so that everyone could make an input. She said the challenges faced by the funding body were not insurmountable if there was a collective effort to face them head-on. “The committee welcomes the willingness of the stakeholders to collectively support a process to ensure that students are not disadvantaged in furthering the much-needed education.” September also called on the funding body to move out of its head office in Wynberg in the Western Cape to a place where it would be accessible to the majority of South Africans. -Afro Voice Reporter
