MINISTER of Mineral Resources Gwede Mantashe has said he hopes the mining charter will be published next month. Mantashe yesterday led a delegation of officials from his department to a community consultation meeting in Carletonville. The meeting formed part of the country-wide community consultations taking place in all mining communities. “We have held consultations on the mining charter in nine areas. “The mining affected communities united in action have submitted constructive inputs in all areas to which we have been,” the minister said. “We want to hear all the views of everyone affected, they will help us to reshape the department going forward. “As we consult, people raise issues beyond the mining charter that affect them daily and we take note of that,” he said. Mantashe said it was important that they took note of all the concerns the community raised especially the social responsibility aspects. He said the consultations were more of an educational drive for the department. “Macua has given us what they call the people’s charter and we are going to incorporate it on the final charter. “This is a continuation of transformation in the mining sector. We cannot reinvent the wheel when we are transforming,” he said. Mantashe said the objective of the charter was also to encourage black communities to produce more black industrialists. He said the consultation process was drawing to a close but would still take place in Welkom and Newcastle where it was hoped that more communities would come out to air their views. “We will be drafting the charter and call a summit that we have promised and present it. After that it will go through all the processes of the government,” he said. The mining charter was challenged by the Chamber of Mines when the former minister, Mosebenzi Zwane, presented it. The minister has called on all the stakeholders to work with his department to put the matter to rest. -TIISETSO MANOKO|tiisetsom@afrotone.co.za
