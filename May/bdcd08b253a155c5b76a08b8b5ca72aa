ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa has on Tuesday doubled down on the importance of dialogue and open engagement between members of the tri-partite alliance even when they don’t see eye to eye on critical issues. Earlier today Ramaphosa addressed an ordinary Central Executive Council meeting of trade federation Cosatu in Braamfontein. Following the closed session meeting, Ramaphosa described the sitting as both cordial and robust where a number of vital issues such as the implementation of the National Minimum Wage as well as the VAT increase, came under the microscope. “The important thing is that we are strengthening the platform for us to engage. We all agreed that there is no alternative for us as alliance members but to engage. “So our engagement on issues that we may not see eye to eye on, should never be issues where the alliance is weakened,” said Ramaphosa. Cosatu was one of Ramaphosa’s staunchest supporters ahead of the 54th ANC National Conference which elected him President. During the conference in December, the ANC resolved to strengthen relations with its alliance partners and avoid public spats through ongoing communication. In the build-up to the conference, relations between the alliance had been marred by tension and a strained relationship. On Tuesday Ramaphosa said they remained committed to their conference resolutions and would facilitate continuous engagements of the political council. Meanwhile, Ramaphosa also briefed Cosatu about the ruling party’s recently unveiled Thuma Mina campaign as it gears up for next years general elections. “We are a governing alliance that needs to deal with issues and lead our people as we campaign,” he said. Cosatu General Secretary, Bheki Ntshalintshali said he was pleased with the outcomes of the engagement which he also described “open and robust”. -Afro Voice Reporter
