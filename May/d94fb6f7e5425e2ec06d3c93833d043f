The Hlanganani police are on a manhunt for suspects involved in the murder of three men and attempted murder. The police discovered three bodies in the bushes near N’wamatatani RDP section on Tuesday and later discovered another man who was still alive not too far from where the others were found. The station commander Lieutenant Moatshe Ngoepe said the man was badly injured with a bullet wound on his left arm and another stuck in his mouth, making it impossible for him to speak. “Communication between him and the police was through writing and he confirmed that he was in the company of the three deceased.” He added that the 25-year-old was rushed to the hospital for medical attention and will explain what happened as soon as his health improves. The police have called on anyone who has information to come forward. -Afro Voice Reporter
