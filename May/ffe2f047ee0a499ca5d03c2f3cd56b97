THE Roast of Somizi Mhlongo, which aired on Comedy Central (DStv122) on Monday turned into the roast of poet and singer, Ntsiki Mazwai, when the invited panel held nothing back and threw all sorts of stings at her. Recorded in front of a live audience on April 26 at Gold Reef City, the Comedy Central annual roast of a celebrity which includes previously roasted celebrities such us Kenny Kunene and Khanyi Mbau, did little roasting on the Idols SA judge but directed the roasting to the outspoken Mazwai, who for a good two hours tried to keep a brave face. The spotlight of the roast soon turned to actress Nomzamo Mbatha, who was one of the panelists, reacting with extreme excitement every time Mazwai was roasted. Mbatha, who was accused of being against the poet could be seen laughing hysterically and later pulled faces seemingly annoyed and bored when Ntsiki’s turn for roasting came. Mbatha even fiddled with her cellphone and fixed her make-up as Mazwai attempted to make a comeback to those who had taken to the podium. Twitter users expressed their disappointment in the star as they flooded her timeline with accusations that she found pleasure in pulling down another woman, meanwhile, her fans were having none of it and quickly reminded other Twitter users that although she seemed extra happy it was in fact Mazwai who started the roast way before it was televised as she often picked on her. Meanwhile, Mazwai’s fans tried to make her feel better and applauded her for taking every roast in her stride. -NONTOKOZO GXUMISA|nontokozog@afrotone.co.za
