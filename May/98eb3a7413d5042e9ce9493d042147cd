MINISTER of Mineral Resources Gwede Mantashe will today attend the memorial service of the seven miners who died last week at SibanyeStillwater. Mantashe will be joining mourners to pay their last respects for the workers who perished on duty following a tragic incident. The department has been under immense pressure from unions, labour experts on the lack of monitoring and evaluation of the mining houses. There have been 26 fatalities recorded since the beginning of the year with unions calling for tough actions to be taken by the department. Mantashe is expected to deliver the keynote address at the memorial service and engage with the workers and their families. -AfroVoice Reporter
