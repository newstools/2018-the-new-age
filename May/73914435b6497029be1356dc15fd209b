The police management in Gauteng has welcomed the hefty life sentence imposed on a convicted serial rapist in the Johannesburg High Court on Tuesday. As the police continue to intensify efforts to bring down gender-based violence, Shadrack Xidada Chauke was found guilty and sentenced to life for each count of rape and attempted murder, translating to 25 life sentences for 23 counts of rape and attempted murder and an additional 254 years for multiple counts of attempted murder and assault with intention to cause grievous bodily harm. Lieutenant General Deliwe De Lange congratulated the investigators, the victim who alerted the police of Chauke’s whereabouts and witnesses who cooperated throughout the investigation. “This sentence will go a long way in encouraging our members to continue to prioritise the investigation of cases against women, children and vulnerable groups.” -Afro Reporter
