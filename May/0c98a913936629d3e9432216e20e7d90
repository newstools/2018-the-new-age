Two Mpumalanga farmers Martins Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen sentenced for the coffin case assault are expected to appear before the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. Jackson and Oosthuizen were sentenced to 11 and 14 years respectively by the High Court sitting in Middelburg after they were found guilty of placing Victor Rethabile Mlotshwa inside a coffin with a snake. The two men forced Mlotshwa into a coffin accusing him of trespassing and stealing copper cables on the farm premises. They also threatened to burn him inside the coffin. Following the incident, the video taken by one of the men on the crime scene went viral on social media. In her judgement, Judge Segopotje Mphahlele sentenced Oosthuizen to three years for assault, five years for kidnapping, seven years for attempted murder and six years for intimidation. Meanwhile, Jackson was sentenced to three years in prison for assault, five years for kidnapping, seven years for attempted murder and six years for intimidation. Mphahlele added a seven-year sentence for defeating the ends of justice after Jackson burned the coffin in which Mlotshwa was placed in. -Afro Voice Reporter
