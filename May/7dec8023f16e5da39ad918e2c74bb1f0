28-year-old Walter Sisulu student, Sibongile Mani briefly appeared at the East London Magistrate court on Tuesday to face charges of theft after she was asked to hand herself over to the Serious and Commercial Crimes Unit of the SAPS by the Hawks. Mani was thrust into the spotlight in 2017 after the National Student Financial Aid(NSFAS) Scheme erroneously deposited R14.1 Million into her student account in June. She later went on a spending spree, allegedly spending R810 000 on expensive cell phones, liquor, perfumes and clothes for three months before NSFAS noticed its error in August. She will appear again in court on July 2 after she was released on a warning. Last year IntelliMalli, an outsourced company contracted to disburse student funding at WSU, appointed an audit firm to institute a forensic investigation into the matter. IntelliMali reimbursed the university with the money that Mani had already spent. -AfroVoice Reporter
