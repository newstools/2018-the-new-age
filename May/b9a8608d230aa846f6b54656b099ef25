Power utility Eskom has assured South Africans that it will keep the lights on as the country head braces itself for winter and will avoid load shedding at all cost. This was the message carried by Eskom’s Interim CEO Phakamani Hadebe during a media briefing regarding the utilities operational plans ahead of the winter period. @AfroVoiceLIVE There will be no load shedding this coming winter #Eskom — GirlOnFire (@ThelmaSong) May 3, 2018 The briefing comes as Eskom has reportedly been suffering from a low stockpile of coal. However, according to Hadebe, a plan has been put in place to make sure that they don’t run dry. Currently, the utility coal stockpile is sitting at 35 days while six of its 15 power stations are at below required stockpile targets. “Measures are in place to address the current coal shortages. The recovery plan includes securing additional coal supplies and a redirection of coal stock to address the imbalance,” said Hadebe The coal shortage has been attributed to financial constraints at Eskom and the hardships experienced by Tegeta. According to the CEO, Eskom is now evaluating tenders to procure 100Mt of coal which will be used over the next five years. -Afro Reporter
