The N1 Highway in Lainsburg in the Karoo outside the Western Cape has been reopened for traffic following a fatal collision earlier this morning. According to Western Cape Traffic Chief Kenny Africa, Five people were killed instantly when two sedans collided on the highway, resulting in the closure on the Prins Albert Road turnoff on the N1. Four occupants of the other vehicle had to be cut out of the wrecked car using jaws of life and are currently recovering in hospital. “Luckily in that vehicle, no one died. All four occupants were taken to a hospital and they sustained some very serious injuries,” Africa said. Africa said at this stage the cause of the fatal accident is not known but investigations are underway to establish that. -Afro Worldview
