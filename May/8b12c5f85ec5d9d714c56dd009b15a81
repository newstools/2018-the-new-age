Popular Kwaito artist and producer Mampintsha has responded to abuse allegations of his former girlfriend and fellow musician Babes Wodumo. This comes after Babes Wodumo, real name, Bongekile Simelane had an interview with Metro FM on Friday wherein during the interview, the presenter, Masechaba Ndlovu revealed that Babes Wodumo was allegedly abused by Mampintsha. Simelane and Mampintsha were engaged, but during the show, the singer revealed that they have since separated. Mampintsha is lying. Babes Wodumo needs to be protected. Police Minister General Bheki Cele should double the security for Babes. #BabesWodumo #Mampintsha #Masechaba pic.twitter.com/dVnxpdxNub — Man's Not Barry Roux (@AdvBarryRoux) May 19, 2018  Following the interview, Mampintsha posted an ‘apology’ through a Facebook post. “This interview and the revelation that I have been physically abusing her, unfortunately, occurs amidst a public outcry on the increasing incidents of violence against women and many of which in recent months have led to the killing of women by their lovers…I am no saint, nor do I plead absolute innocence in the claims made in that interview….I want to apologise to South Africa for the disappointing you and discourage other men out there who may find themselves in my situation or different one that challenges your emotional stability and restrain,” he said. Ndlovu has also announced that Simelane will allegedly be offered police protection. I’ve just received an update from Babes Management that Min.Bheki Cele has offered her protection. We are truly thankful. #NotInMyName — Masechaba Ndlovu (@MasechabaNdlovu) May 19, 2018  Meanwhile, Mampintsha said the accuracy of the abuse claims, the build-up to the interview, the motive and the timing….is a matter I will leave to decide its fate. Following the interview, social media users have applauded Ndlovu for “speaking against woman abuse”. -Afro Reporter
