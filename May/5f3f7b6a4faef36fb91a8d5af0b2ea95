Star fashion designer David Tlale has partnered with Vodacom to offer Durban July fans a unique lifestyle and fashion experience. Vodacom said it would add “a bit of red” to unique lifestyle experiences by partnering with Tlale. The iconic luxury designer is to create a RED collection at this year’s event. Known for his love for the colour black, the Vosloorus-born designer will embrace a bit of red for the first time in his career, with a once-off limited collection showcasing at the main stage at the Vodacom Durban July. “Red is shorthand for passion, strength and power, yet remains modern and feminine,” he said. “In this collection, I’ve played with various hues and fabrics which speak an entirely new language. “Each look will showcase the story one tells when wearing this, the boldest of all the colours.” Head of Vodacom sponsorships, Michelle van Eyden, said: “Vodacom red is for the individual who expects more and we couldn’t think of anyone better than Tlale to collaborate with in presenting an exceptional showcase of South African design at the #VDJ18. It’s a truly exciting partnership.”
