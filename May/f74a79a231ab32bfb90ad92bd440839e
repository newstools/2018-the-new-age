26 members of the Black First Land First (BLF) are expected to appear at the Pretoria Regional Court on Monday. The BLF members were arrested in 2016 for public violence, trespassing, assault, and kidnapping during a protest at the offices of the former Public Protector, Adv Thuli Madonsela. The group is accused of occupying the office’s of the Public Protector in protest over Madonsela’s ‘refusal’ to act and investigate a complaint lodged with her office in 2011 regarding a sum of R26 billion allegedly stolen during the apartheid era. “ Madonsela got the police to arrest the BLF26. During her tenure Thuli Madonsela investigated so-called black corruption to distract the public’s attention from white corruption,” said BLF.  #FresBLF26: 26 BLF members (also known as the #BLF26) will appear again this morning in the Pretoria Regional Court – located at the corner of Francis Baard & Sophie De Bruyn Street in Pretoria – on empty allegations of public violence, trespassing, assault, and kidnapping. — BLACK 1ST LAND 1ST (@Black1stLand1st) May 7, 2018  -Afro Reporter
