THE ANC in the Northern Cape said the meeting between national executive committee members and the Namaqua region went well. The provincial structure disbanded the regional leadership late last year following a fall-out with the PEC. Disgruntled members in the region approached the national leadership for intervention. A member close to the developments said there were a lot of unresolved matters that the province needed to deal with. “The members who were part of the disbanded regional committee feel that they were purged following the Nasrec and Colesberg outcomes. “People believe that they are being targeted because they were not in support of the current leadership and their views are being suppressed,” the source said. Meanwhile ANC deployee in the province Collen Maine said most of the members were still having hangovers from the Colesberg conference. He said it was important for party members to close ranks because the elections were near. “We need to forget and get over Colesberg outcomes and rally behind the elected leadership. Comrades should not be preoccupied by the list of who will be the MEC and premier next year but they should focus on winning elections,” he said. Maine, together with other deployees Sfiso Buthelezi and Derek Hanekom visited the embattled region to quell the infighting. He urged all the party structures to close ranks and refocus their energies on winning elections and not factions. The ANC in the province said Maine’s visit was part of introducing him as the convener and assessing the structures of the party. The Namakwa region is the only region that has not convened its regional conference following the December conferences by three other regions. Some of the disgruntled members concerns were the appointment of Mervin Cloete as the regional convenor. They have cited him as the person the PEC want to impose on them to be the regional leader. tiisetso@afrotone.co.za -TIISETSO MANOKO
