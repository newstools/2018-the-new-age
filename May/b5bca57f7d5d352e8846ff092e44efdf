Gauteng Community Safety MEC, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane has revealed on Tuesday that there have been 96 cash-in-transit cases in Gauteng in the past nine months. This is during the period August 2017 to May 2018. During these robberies, the police have managed to recover R95 million in stolen cash. “To date, a total number 96 cash in transit cases have been reported, while 44 armored vehicles were attacked with 52 of them taking place on cross pavement,” said Nkosi-Malobane in a statement. This comes after the recent spike in reported cash-in-transit heists that have been experienced in the province and across the country. In the statement, the MEC says she has since instructed a crime intelligence team to work around the clock to deal decisively with the matter. “Criminals are proving to be sophisticated lately, therefore a collective approach to deal with heists is critical. It is important that we commit all our resources and engage all the Law Enforcement Agencies to deal with this challenge. We cannot allow these criminals to walk our streets and instill fear amongst ordinary citizens,” she said. A number of arrests have been made in some of these cases. Six people were arrested earlier this month for a cash-in-transit heist that took place in Randburg while four people were found in the position of about R1.5m in cash in a house suspected to be stolen during one of the recent robberies were arrested in Tsakane last week. The MEC says that there are only 11 cases where arrests were made while 85 suspects are still at large. The actual number of suspects arrested to date amounts to 26 in total. -AfroVoice Reporter
