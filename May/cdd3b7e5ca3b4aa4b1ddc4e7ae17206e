Public Service and Administration Minister Ayanda Dlodlo has moved to clarify weekend media reports that she has been using a Ministerial home in Pretoria. On Sunday, City Press reported that former Mineral resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane and former Public Enterprise Minister Faith Muthambi were refusing to vacate the ministerial residences at Bryntirion Estate near the Union Buildings. The two were shafted by President Cyril Ramaphosa when he appointed his new cabinet in February. The newspaper also reported that Dlodlo, who was part of former president Jacob Zuma’s cabinet has been using a home provided by the state. Dlodlo has since taken to a social network,  Twitter saying she wished to correct what she called ‘factual inaccuracies’ in the story. She said she has never stayed in a government house in Pretoria and that she had no intention of doing so. “I have no interest in doing so, I have my own house in JHB and the drive to Pretoria is less than an hour,” Dlodlo said in her Tweet. Dear @City_Press I would like to correct some factual inaccuracies in your story written by Jan De Lange,I have never stayed in a Government house in Pretoria.I have no interest in doing so,I have my own house in JHB and the drive to Pretoria is less than an hour.
