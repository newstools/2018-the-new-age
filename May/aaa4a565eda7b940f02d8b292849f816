Democratic Alliance (DA) Gauteng leader John Moody said the party will go ahead with tabling a motion of no confidence against premier David Makhura. Moody said there are many reasons that they will give all in support of Makhuras’s removal from office. He says the Life Esidimeni tragedy, which occurred under Makhura’s watch is just one of the reasons why he should be toppled from his position. “144 Esidimeni patients suffered cruel and unnatural deaths because no one in the Gauteng government was heeding the warnings that a tragedy of epic proportions was unfolding,” he said. Makhura on Sunday dismissed calls by the DA for his removal as nothing but electioneering ahead of the 2019 elections. Moody said it was under Makhura’s watch that many vulnerable people in society have died, hence the motion against him. ” Any reasonable leader would understand when to step down when …that is why we believe PremierMakhura is not fit to hold that office,” Moody said. The motion is expected to be tabled and debated on May 15. -Afro Reporter
