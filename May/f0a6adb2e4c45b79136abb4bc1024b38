Democratic Alliance (DA) Shadow MEC of Health Jack Bloom has strongly condemned the trashing of Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital and calls for action to be taken against employees. Members affiliated with the labour federation National Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) are demanding payment for overtime work they have done in the past. Entrances to the hospital were barricaded with burning tyres and rubbish bins flipped over with medical waste spread across the passages at the hospital and sick patients being threatened by the rioting workers. The hospital had to shut its gates after rioters threatened to cause more damage to the hospital infrastructure. According to Bloom, workers are demanding performance bonuses which have not been paid for in the past two years. Bloom said whatever workers demands are, nothing justifies trashing the hospital and jeopardising patients lives. “We are told the national department of health people are going to be addressing the situation soon, but we have been here the whole day and nothing has happened.” Attempts to get a comment from the Department of Health were unsuccessful. -Afro Voice Reporter
