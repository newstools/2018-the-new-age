SOUTH Africa will struggle to stick to a promise to cut spending if the government fails to agree to an inflation-linked wage increase with civil service trade unions, Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene said yesterday. Plans to reduce government spending helped SA avoid a damaging credit rating downgrade by Moody’s in March but the promised cuts provoked criticism from unions, civil society and opposition parties. The government, and public sector unions representing teachers, nurses and the police, have been locked in negotiations over wage increases since late last year. Unions are lobbying for above-inflation pay rises of about 12% while the government has tabled offers linked to consumer inflation at 3.8%. “There are risks to maintaining the expenditure ceiling over the medium term, which include the public service wage agreement and the financial position of several state-owned companies,” Nene told Parliament during a Treasury presentation. Last month the Public Servants’ Association, which represents 230000 public sector workers, declared a dispute with the government. Cosatu, the country largest, has also threatened to pull out of negotiations. In a cost-cutting measure to cap ballooning debt, the Treasury lifted VAT for the first time in more than two decades in its February budget. – Reuters
