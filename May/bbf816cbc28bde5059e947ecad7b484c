THE National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) has said their members were happy with the government’s latest wage offer. Spokesperson Khaya Xaba said they had gone on a vigorous report back to their members at the weekend regarding the offer the government had presented. Speaking to Afro Voice yesterday, Xaba said the offer, which included pay progression for teachers and TVET lecturers, de-linking housing allowance among others came after extensive engagements and persuasion. “Look, we started reporting on Friday to our members who were mainly happy with the progress we had made. “Yes, the members are happy with the offer presented taking into account the economic outlook our country is faced with, we could only try our best in the situation,” he said. Xaba said the government had agreed to bringing forward the implementation of housing allowances that would see 400000 public servants who were previously excluded, receiving the allowance. “The employer has also agreed to look at the abolishing of salary level 1-3, as we have said we want the levels to start from 4. “Our members are happy with the salary adjustment which include level 1-7 being 7%, level 8-10 being 6.5% and level 11-12.6%. “We will be doing final engagements today (yesterday) before we go and sign the agreement tomorrow (today),” he said.
