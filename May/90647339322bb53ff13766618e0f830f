THE Gauteng department of education is concerned at the low number of online applications for Grade 1 and 8 at township schools ahead of tomorrow’s deadline for the closure of applications. The department said there were 385 township schools with less than 50 applications, 79 schools with less than 20 and 69 schools with less than 10 applications. “It is a concern that in the last two years many parents in townships waited for the late application period and flooded GDE offices in January to apply for their children. The department is moving away from late applications and parents who do not apply online by midnight on the May 28 (tonight) are running the risk of having their children out of school in January next year,” spokesperson, Steve Mabona said. Mabona said there were 596 schools where demand exceeded available spaces based on the number of applications registered to date. Some of these schools have recorded between 1 538 and 1 960 applications for either Grade 1 or Grade 8. To date, the department has received 251 808 applications for Grade 1 and 283 256 for Grade 8, a total of 535 064 applications. The department has urged parents from other provinces who are planning to move to Gauteng to apply online before the closing date. Mabona said parents should note that availability of space is the key determinant of how many children can be placed in a school. “We are indebted to all the many parents who heeded our call and applied, the response from the public was indeed overwhelming, Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi said. shonisanit@afrotone.co.za
