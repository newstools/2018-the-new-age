THE soccer coach who sexually abused 29 teenage boys he recruited for his bogus soccer academy died yesterday morning, police spokesperson Capt Mavela Masondo said. “The suspect passed away in hospital this morning and we are still waiting for the post-mortem to confirm the cause of his death,” Masondo said. This comes just days after the boys who were abused by the man were reunited with their families. The 34-yearold man, who raped the boys for months after luring them to his academy in Protea Glen, Soweto, had been hospitalised under police guard after attempting to commit suicide. The man, who is originally from Limpopo, had attempted to poison himself before being arrested last week. The Gauteng department of social development arranged for the transportation of the boys aged 14 to 18, most of whom are from Burgersfort. But the parents of 13 of the boys asked that they remain in Soweto. The department of social development spokesperson, Mbangwa Xaba, said their sister department in Limpopo was dealing with the matter. “When you provide psychosocial support you have to assess the client’s needs and then tailor-make the response,” Xaba said. SA Football Association spokesperson Dominic Chimhavi urged parents to do background checks on academies. –HLONI MASHIGO|hlonim@afrotone.co.za
