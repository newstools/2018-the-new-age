NATIONALISATION of the Reserve Bank is unlikely to happen any time soon if President Cyril Ramaphosa has his way. Despite the proposal being endorsed as official policy at the ANC’s national conference in December, the new government has since backtracked from the idea and the proposal appears to be, at best, on the back burner. Ramaphosa told the South African National Editors Forum in Cape Town last week that he was committed to keeping the Bank an independent entity. This follows Deputy President David Mabuza avoiding answering questions from the DA on the subject in Parliament earlier last week. And in March, a scheduled parliamentary motion on the issue was shelved to allow for “further consultation”, allegedly at the behest of Finance Minister Nhlhanhla Nene who was concerned at the possible reaction of ratings agencies. To nationalise the Bank, the state would have to buy out private shareholders – seen as a largely symbolic exrecise as they have no influence on the policies or day-to-day running of the Bank. Reserve Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago has warned that a change of ownership could raise financial and economic risks. Analysts say Ramaphosa’s comments are a clear signal that nationalisation of the Bank “will never happen”. Earlier this year, economist Dawie Roodt wrote that the Bank had assets of R170bn on its balance sheet and was therefore “a target for spendthrift ministers”. -BERNARD SATHEKGE|bernards@afrotone.co.za
