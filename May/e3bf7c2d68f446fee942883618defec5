Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has appointed former Passenger Rail Agency of South Afric (Prasa) board chairperson Popo Molefe as the chairperson of Transnet’s new interim board. Molefe previously chaired the Prasa until 2017. Molefe was appointed as chair of the new board alongside Louis Zeuner, Ramasela Ganda, Ursula Fikelepi, Edward Kieswetter and Dimakatso Matshoga. In a statement, Gordhan said that Transnet has been clouded with serious allegations of corruptions and maladministration which the previous board had failed to seriously deal with. “The previous board has not demonstrated an appreciation of the seriousness of the issues at hand or the ability to deal with these decisively in order to protect the entity in the interest of South Africans,” said Gordhan. Gordhan has expressed confidence in the ability of the newly appointed leaders to bring stability to the state entity. Meanwhile, the remaining Transnet board members were removed with immediate effect. Molefe said that he and the newly appointed board members were going to make sure that they provide ‘ethical leadership and good governance,’ and discharge the mandate of the organization. Molefe has vowed to fix the challenges that Transnet is faced with. “We got to make sure that we demonstrate that we want to do things differently. We want to uphold the values of on Nelson Mandela and leaders who came before us,” said Molefe to Power FM on Tuesday. -Afro Reporter
