Three police officers stationed at Mamelodi West police station will be served with letters of suspension today following the mishandling of missing ten-year-old Katlego Joja’s case. The announcement comes after Gauteng MEC for Community Safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane visited the police station and Joja’s family to find out about what happened when her family went to report her missing. The body of Joja who was diagnosed with autism was found by a community member floating in a stream not far from her home three days after she was reported missing. Nkosi-Malobane said she believed the family when they said they were badly treated by the police when they went to report Katlego missing. “From our investigation, we know that there were three people who were involved who actually misled the family.” According to Joja’s family, they were turned away at the police station on three occasions when they went to report her missing. The family said they were told to wait twenty-four hours before they could open a missing person docket. Nkosi-Malobane said she will be redeploying two senior police managers to other stations due to what she called an unethical conduct in handling Joja’s case. -Afro Reporter
