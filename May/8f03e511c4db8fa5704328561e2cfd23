KAGISO Rabada is in line to join AB de Villiers, Makhaya Ntini, Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis to have won the South Africa cricketer of the year twice. Rabada won the award in 2016 and following his impressive performance this season, he has been nominated for the same award together with Aiden Markram, De Villiers, Dean Elgar and Vernon Philander. The 22 year old inspired the Proteas to defeat India and Australia in Test series this season while also returning to being ranked the No 1 Test bowler worldwide. De Villiers, who has already won the award twice, will be looking for a hat-trick. The nominees for the awards, which will take place on June 2 at Sandton Convention Centre, were announced yesterday â€“ with Rabada having been nominated in four categories. He has been nominated for SA cricketer of the year, Test cricketer of the year, ODI cricketer of the year and Ram delivery of the year. -NEVILLE KHOZA
