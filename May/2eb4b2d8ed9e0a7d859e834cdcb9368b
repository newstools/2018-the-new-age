THE National Prosecuting Authority has not conducted lifestyle audits for the past three financial years and there are no plans in place to carry out a standard of living assessments. But Jan Mothibi, the head of the country’s other elite crime fighting unit, the Special Investigating Unit, was vetted by the State Security Agency before he assumed duties on May 1, 2016. This was disclosed by Justice and Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha in a written reply to a question on the subject by DA MP Hendrik Schmidt. Masutha said he had been informed that the Department of Justice and Correctional Services had not conducted general lifestyle audits in relation to senior management. “We have limited our policies and procedures to vetting processes and identification of risk, based on declarations of interest. In terms of statistics relating to incidents of fraud and corruption, it seems that the risk exposure to the department is not at senior management level but rather at middle management and lower levels and specifically in specialised environments. No lifestyle audits have been conducted in the NPA in the past three financial years. Currently, there are no plans in place to conduct lifestyle audits.” The CEO of Legal Aid South Africa, Masutha said, has also not been subjected to a lifestyle audit for the past three years. “However, the internal audit department of Legal Aid South Africa conducted lifestyle audits for the past three financial years based on an assessment of potential risks from employees who are in direct interaction with clients or are handling financial transactions of the organisation.” The audits cover legal practitioners, paralegals and administration managers. “In the 2018-19 financial year a lifestyle audit is planned of all persons involved in procurement at national and provincial level.” -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN|news@afrotone.co.za
