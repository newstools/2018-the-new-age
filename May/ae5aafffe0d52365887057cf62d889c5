Deputy President David Mabuza can expect to face tough questions from members of parliament when he appears in the National Assembly on Tuesday. Mabuza will have to explain the reasons for the government’s intervention in the North
West province and he will also be quizzed about the South African National Aids Council. The Inter-ministerial Task Team resolved to place the entire provincial government under administration after uncovering several cases of maladministration and alleged corruption. Mabuza made a public appearance at the funeral of the late anti-apartheid photojournalist  Sam Nzima on Saturday. Last week Economic Freedom Fighters(EFF) leader Julius Malema joked that he would open a missing person’s case for Mabuza. -AfroVoice Reporter
