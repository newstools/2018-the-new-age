ANC national spokesperson Pule Mabe has on Friday refuted reports of alleged corruption which have surfaced against him. This comes as the Mail & Guardian newspaper published a report in which the publication claims that last year in June, the Mvest Trust, which Mabe is alleged to be a trustee of, was awarded an R49-million tender by the North West Development Corporation (NWDC) despite Mabe being a member of parliament at the time. MPs are legally not allowed to benefit from a tender with an organ of state. However, Mabe has denied any wrongdoing and has issued a statement where he claims he is at the receiving end of “Inaccurate Reporting”. “The Mail and Guardian especially Mr Thanduxolo Jika the author of the sensational story fails this basic test. The story is littered with inaccuracies that a senior journalist like him should have taken care to verify prior to publishing,” said Mabe. In his statement, he also bemoans the ease with which the media ‘cast doubt on people that hold public office’. Mabe has since announced his intention to refer the matter to the Press Ombudsman. According to him, this will present an opportunity for the Mail and Guardian “to present facts and supporting evidence so as to address this issue once and for all”. -Afro Reporter
