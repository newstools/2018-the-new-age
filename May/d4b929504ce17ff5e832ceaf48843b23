THE Public Servants Association (PSA) says the government was negotiating in bad faith by not increasing its offer while the association has lowered its demands. The parties are due for conciliation this morning where a full-blown strike could be averted. The deputy general manager of PSA, Tahir Maepa, said they were going back to the table with the hope of bringing the nine-month negotiations to an end. Maepa said should the conciliation fail, they would have no choice but to engage their workers to down tools. “The reason for a meeting is for us and the government to find one another on this matter.” Maepa said on Friday they rejected the offer by the employer during the public service negotiations at the Public Service Co-ordinating Bargaining Council. Unions are demanding wage increases of between 10% and 12%. The employer has offered CPI plus 1.5% to 0.5% for the highest paid workers. “If our demands are still not met, then the PSA will ballot its members for a possible strike action. We call upon all unions in the public service to stay united behind our consolidated demands,” Maepa said. A strike in the public sector could see government departments coming to their knees with more than 200000 public service workers represented. The government’s opening offer was CPI increases for junior and mid-level government employees on levels was 1 to 10, an increase of CPI plus 1% for senior government employees on level 11 to 12 and a three-year deal. Maepa said they had reduced their demands on two occasions to move closer to the employer’s offer. The Department of Public Service and Administration said they were hopeful that they could still find one another with the PSA. Departmental representative Mava Scott said what was important was that all the stakeholders fashion out what works for all of them. -TIISETSO MANOKO|tiisetsom@afrotone.co.za
