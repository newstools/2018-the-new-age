THE death of award-winning film director Carlos Carvalho who was killed after being hit by a giraffe while shooting close-ups of the wild animal at game lodge in North West has left the local film industry shaken. The latest incident comes just days after the country celebrated Worker’s Day and two weeks after the death of actor Odwa Shweni who died while filming in Drakensberg last month, while female workers continue to suffer sexual abuse at the hands of their male colleagues. South African Guild of Actors vicechairperson Adrian Galley said in light of all these incidents, the local industry had little to celebrate as the labour laws render employees in the film and television industries helpless. “Actors in the South African film and entertainment industry are vulnerable to economic exploitation and face risks to life and limb because the laws of the country continue to fail them. “The legal status of an actor is that of an atypical worker, performers are considered to be independent contractors rather than employees. “For this reason, they are specifically excluded from the protections afforded other workers by the raft of labour legislation that includes the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, the Unemployment Insurance Act, the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act and, importantly, the Occupational Health and Safety Act. “As long as actors and other freelancers are denied their right to make a meaningful contribution, they will remain at the mercy of a handful of unscrupulous producers who either pay lip service to safety regulations or flout them altogether,” Galley said. Carvalho was sent flying almost five metres through the air after Gerald the giraffe head butted him‚ causing fatal head injuries. -SIYABONGA SITHOLE|siyabongas@afrotone.co.za
