PERCY Tau avoided being sold to Bidvest Wits and Ajax Cape Town by Mamelodi Sundowns as he fought his way to where he is today. The outstanding season the 23 year old has had is a testament to the hard work Tau invested in his career and his domination at yesterday’s PSL seasonend awards’ nominations is just reward. The Sundowns star was nominated in the footballer of the season and player’s player of the season categories, alongside his captain Hlompho Kekana and Maritzburg United midfielder Siphesihle Ndlovu. The turning point in his career came when he was loaned out to Witbank Spurs two seasons ago where he duly impressed and was promptly recalled at the beginning of last season by Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane. The rest is now history. What is now left is for those who know best, such as Mosimane’s former assistant Rhulani Mokoena, is to sing his praises. Mokoena, a young lion in his own right, now assisting Orlando Pirates coach Milutin Sredojevic, admits to being inspired by Tau’s progress. “Sundowns almost lost Percy twice, they almost sold him to Wits and Ajax Cape Town under Ian Tylor,” Mokoena said. “I’m saying this to show you the perseverance, the fight and the dedication that Percy has to be where he is today. It has not been easy. “Sometimes, we see the beauty at the top of iceberg and forget the pain, the suffering. “For me, having known the story of Percy and where he comes from and what he has achieved, I think he has really improved and gone through a hell of a lot to be where he is now.” Tau is expected to walk away with all the awards he has been nominated in, while he is also guaranteed the top goal scorer award he shares with Polokwane City’s Rodney Ramagalela. nevillek@afrotone.co.za
