The Mahikeng Tactical Response Team (TRT) together with the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime unit led to the arrest of two suspects for alleged abduction, rape, sexual exploitation and trafficking of a 17-year-old Lichtenburg girl. The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation received a tip-off and immediately with the assistance of the TRT went to the suspected house unannounced and arrested the two suspects. “The young girl was found inside the house which is alleged to be a prostitution den. The young girl was rescued and taken to a place of safety,” the Hawks said in a statement. The pair appeared in Lichtenburg Magistrate Court on Wednesday and will remain in custody until their next appearance on, June 27, pending further investigation. The Provincial Head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations Major General Linda Mbana urged the community not to turn a blind eye on such situations as reporting these kinds of crimes could potentially save a life. -Afro Voice Reporter
