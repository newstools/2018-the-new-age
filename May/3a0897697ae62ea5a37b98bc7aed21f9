Former President Jacob Zuma’s oldest son Edward has seven days to apologise to South Africans and pay R30 000 to two schools for attacks aimed at Minister of Public Enterprise Derek Hanekom and Minister of Public Enterprise Pravin Gordhan. He will be paying the amounts to Umthombo Secondary School in Howick and Ohlange High School in Inanda. Last year, the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) approached the Equality Court in Durban requesting it to find Zuma guilty of hate speech and to issue him with an R100 000 fine for open letters he wrote about the two minister, who have been some of his father’s biggest critics. In 2017, he was also ordered by the ANC to apologise for his attack on the ministers after he called them sellouts antimajoritarians. In his open letter, he described the two ministers as “anti-majoritarian sell-out minority in the ANC who have brazenly and unabashedly spoken out against Zuma on various white-monopoly media platforms”. Referring to Gordhan, Zuma said: “This privileged boy from Sastri College shows us that he would defend whites and their appointed crumb eaters‚ the White Monopoly Capital Indunas‚ the black parasitical political stooges at all costs”. In April, Zuma penned another open letter in which he slammed Hanekom who had criticised Zuma in after an announcement that former president was set to marry 24-year-old Nonkanyiso Conco as his fifth wife and that the two have recently had a baby. “Advice to Hanekom the settler… nonsensical vomit that Hanekom has threw up on our culture and the manner in which he disrespects our rich tradition. I say this after he took to social media to vent his disgust to an old practice called polygamy,” part of his letter read. -Afro Voice Reporter
