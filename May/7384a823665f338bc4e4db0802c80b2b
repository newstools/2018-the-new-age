Zimbabwe will hold its general elections on July 30, President Emmerson Mnangagwa said on Wednesday, the first since the army forced 94-year-old former president Robert Mugabe to resign last November. Mnangagwa, who became president following the military take-over, has promised to deliver on free and fair elections to win over Zimbabweâ€™s critics at home and abroad. The vote will pit him against a clutch of opponents including 40-year-old Nelson Chamisa from the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change. Reuters
