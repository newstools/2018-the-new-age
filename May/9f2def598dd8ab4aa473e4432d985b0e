The police in Gauteng have arrested four people on Tuesday following the discovery of R1.5 million cash at a house in Tsakane suspected to have been stolen during a recent cash in transit robbery in Boksburg last week According to police, the arrests come after they received a tip-off about money that was stashed in the house. “When we went there we found a couple aged 58 and 59. The couple was having a certain amount of cash in their position. Upon enquiring about the other money they pointed us to a place where they hid the money underground in a trunk.” said EMPD spokesperson Clifford Shongwe. He said that upon investigation, one of the suspects pointed the police to another place where they further made a discovery of hidden cash. Four CIT robbers reportedly  arrested and R1,5million recovered in Ekhurhuleni. Well done! For the record, no @SBVSouthAfrica guard was among those arrested and claimed on social media. #CITRobberies #MakePeopleSafe #MakeMoneySafe. @SAPoliceService pic.twitter.com/DZF1br8dj6 — Yusuf Abramjee (@Abramjee) May 22, 2018  The police said that one of the suspects that have arrested can be linked to an employee of SBV. Meanwhile, SBV has distanced itself from images that were shared on social media which claim that a security guard reportedly found with the cash was their employee. We're aware of a tweet that implicates a SBV employee in a recent heist. Authorities have confirmed that THIS IS NOT a SBV employee. Investigations are still underway. Please share. We're committed to working with authorities to apprehend criminals involved in #CITRobberies. — SBVSouthAfrica (@SBVSouthAfrica) May 22, 2018  -AfroVoice Reporter
