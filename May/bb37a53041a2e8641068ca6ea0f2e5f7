WHILE the government does not have official statistics available for revenue generated by the predator-breeding industry, it is estimated that lion breeders annually contribute R500m to the South African economy. Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa was responding in writing to a written parliamentary question from DA MP Ross Purdon, she said information supplied by provincial conservation management authorities said it was estimated that an amount of R111m was generated from hunting activities during 2016 and R181m during 2015 respectively. The information for last year’s hunting activities would only be available after the end of June. “However, the recent International Journal of Biodiversity and Conservation as appearing on the academic journal of the Northwest University by Peet Van der Merwe et al, 2017, said that lion breeders alone contribute R500m annually to the South African economy in each of the past three financial years. “Please note that at the national level we do not have statistics. Such stats are compiled by provincial nature conservation authorities on an annual basis.” Molewa said that information on tourism activities, including the sale of predators to other hunting facilities, bone sales and tax revenue contributed by the predator-breeding industry to the national revenue fund in each of the specified financial years was not available to the Department of Environmental Affairs at the moment. –DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
