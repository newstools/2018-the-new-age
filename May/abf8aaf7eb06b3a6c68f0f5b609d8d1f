Triple murder accused Henri van Breda has on Monday been found guilty of all charges. Van Breda was found guilty of murdering his parents and his older brother at their luxury resident in De Zalze outside Stellenbosch, Western Cape in 2015. Western Cape High Court Judge Siraj Desai also found Van Breda guilty of attempted murder of his sister and defeating the ends of justice. While delivering his marathon judgment, Desai dismissed most of the evidence that was presented by Van Breda and his lawyer in his defence including his testimony that his family was attacked by an axe-wielding man wearing a balaclava. Desai also acknowledged that most of the state’s case was based on a circumstantial evidence. The court will hear arguments in aggravation and mitigation of sentence at a later date. -Afro Reporter
