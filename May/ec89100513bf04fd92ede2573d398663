SABC1 received a backlash from scores of social media users for failing to air the full funeral service and the memorial service of one of its employees, Akhumzi Jezile, who died in a car accident last week. On Saturday, the channel started broadcasting the service at 9am and cut it at 10am to make way for Generations – The Legacy omnibus. Taking to Twitter, fans of Jezile collectively agreed that the least the public broadcaster could have done was postpone the repeat of the soapie for one day. Meanwhile, the channel apologised for cutting the service and taking it to You tube and also apologised for the poor sound quality. Fans of the star slammed the channel, arguing that they did not have data to stream the funeral on the internet. Others said the elders who could not use smartphones let alone work the internet were excluded in the process. Others were of the view that they would boycott paying their TV licence as they were not satisfied with the broadcaster’s services. In true social media style, other social media users defended the channel and said it was a business and should stick to its schedule especially because Jezile like many others, was just an employee. -NONTOKOZO GXUMISA|nontokozog@afrotone.co.za
