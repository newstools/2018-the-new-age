POLICE Minister Bheki Cele will today host a social crime prevention imbizo at the Tshwane
UniversityÂ of Technology in Soshanguve. The imbizo follows an invitation by the students who raised serious concerns with the minister about crime incidences that have turned the campus into a mini war zone with multiple cases of women assault and abuse on the rise. The latest attack was last week when a first-year student was overpowered in a toilet and almost raped. Reports said that her would-be rapist slapped her in the face and stabbed her in the tongue to silence her screams. He was caught by a security guard and arrested.
