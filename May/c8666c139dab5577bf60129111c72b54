Advocacy group Corruption Watch says while it welcomes the filing of disciplinary charges against suspended South African Revenue Services (SARS) Commissioner, Tom Moyane, they remain concerned about the National Prosecuting Authority(NPA)’s apparent reluctance to prosecute him. According to Corruption Watch, they were informed by the NPA that the prosecuting body was reviewing its decision not to prosecute Moyane. The lobby group asked the NPA to issue a certificate indicating that it would not be prosecuting Moyane, therefore, enabling it to pursue private prosecution proceedings against Moyane. Moyane was suspended from his duties at Sars by president Cyril Ramaphosa in March after he said that he has lost confidence in his ability to run the revenue body. Earlier this month, the Presidency announced that Moyane would be served with disciplinary charges linked to alleged misconduct and a violation of his duties and responsibilities at Sars. Corruption Watch said ever since the suspicious activities against former Sars Chief Officer for business and individual tax, Jonas Makwakwa were revealed by the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC), and Moyane’s failure to take appropriate action, it has been engaging with the Hawks and the NPA demanding an investigation into, and prosecution of, what appears to be strong prima facie evidence of unlawful conduct on the part of Moyane and Makwakwa. Corruption Watch Chief Director David Lewis said Moyane’s behaviour at Sars warranted prosecution to be pursued against him. “It has damaged the integrity and credibility of Sars, a critical institution in South Africa’s success, and Moyane cannot be allowed to escape with disciplinary sanctions alone,” Lewis said in a statement. Lewis said the lobby group will continue to demand that the NPA institute a prosecution against Moyane or else they would do so themselves. -Afro Reporter
