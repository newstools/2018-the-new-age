Under fire, North West Premier and ANC Chairperson Supra Mahumapelo is expected to lead the party’s provincial working committee during a meeting with the National Working Committee (NWC) on Monday. The meeting is expected to be held at the party’s headquarters in Luthuli House where Mahumapelo’s fate as premier could also be sealed. There have been increased calls for Mahumapelo to resign from his position as premier after allegations of corruption against him emerged. His entire provincial government was placed under administration following an assessment by the interministerial task team due to allegations of widespread corruption and maladministration. He indicated that he would be resigning from his position but later changed his mind after the provincial leadership in the North West refused to accept his resignation. Mahumapelo appointed Finance MEC Wendy Nelson as acting premier after placing himself on an indefinite leave of absence. He also opened a case of conspiracy to commit a crime at Mmabatho police station saying he has received a tip-off that someone has been paid R250 000 to have him killed. Sunday newspaper City Press quoted the Hawks sources who said they did not believe there was a credibility to Mahumapelo’s allegations that someone has been paid R250 000 to kill him. According to City Press, investigators were questioning the authenticity of the plot after a woman came forward, claiming to have a knowledge of the plot but, according to the newspaper could not provide names of those who paid the money to have the premier killed. -Afro Reporter
