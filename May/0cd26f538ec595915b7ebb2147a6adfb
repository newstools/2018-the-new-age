THE MEC of the treasury, Elsabe Rockman, delivered the department’s budget vote of just more than R350m in Thaba Nchu outside Bloemfontein. A quarter of the budget, R76m, went towards assisting embattled municipalities in the Free State. Rockman said they had reassessed the impact of municipalities and decided to put a large chunk into aiding them. “The focus of the plan is to improve the overall financial well-being of municipalities in and around the province. We also want to improve municipal budget and financial management as well as enhancing service delivery,” she said. Rockman said they intended to roll out the process of the verification of the integrity of the payrolls of municipalities. The support of municipalities comes as a number of municipalities are struggling with Eskom and water board debts. Municipalities in the province initially owed Eskom R6.2bn and water boards R2bn. The affected municipalities however have since made payment arrangements with the power utility and water boards. The provincial treasury will continue to work with office of the premier, Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and South African Local Government Association to explore viable options. michaelt@afrotone.co.za -MICHAEL TLHAKUDI
