PERCY Tau capped off a spectacular season with the coveted footballer of the season award at a star-studded gala dinner in the PSL awards at the Sandton Convention Centre last night. Tau, who finished the season as joint top goal-scorer with Polokwane City striker Rodney Ramagalela, also walked away with the player’s player of the season award as voted by his peers. Tau was outstanding this season for both Sundowns and the national team having also finished with 11 assists in the league. He was favoured to walk away with the big award and his victory came as no surprise after he played a key role in helping Sundowns to a record eighth league title. Tau looks to have played his last game for Sundowns with coach Pitso Mosimane saying that he is already preparing for life without his star player after receiving offers from overseas. “He has done very well and we should expect somebody to call from Europe,” Mosimane said. “There are talks already. I’m preparing to lose him. It is going to be tough for us. “But as I say always, tough when you lose CBD and all that, we continued, we lost (Elias) Pelembe, Surprise (Moriri), (Katlego) Mphela, key players. “Alje Schut was a captain, a pillar of strength. But we now have to replace.” Maritzburg United midfielder Siphesihle Ndlovu, who also impressed this season, walked away with the young player and midfielder of the season gongs. Ndlovu was outstanding as he helped the Team of Choice to a best-ever finish of fourth in the league and also guided them to the Nedbank Cup final which they lost to Free State Stars. Ndlovu was nominated with Tau for the footballer of the season and player’s player of the season awards. Mosimane walked away with the coach of the season award, beating out Milutin Sredojevic and Fadlu Davids after he guided the Brazilians to the league title. -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@ afrotone.co.za
