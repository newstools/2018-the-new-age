XOLA Mlambo feels he has finally settled at Orlando Pirates following his impressive performance in their final match of the season against Free State Stars on Saturday. Mlambo, who was named man of the match after helping the Buccaneers end the season on a high note with a 2-1 victory, was able to earn his first award since joining the club in January from Bidvest Wits. The 27 year old credited his form to the input of the technical team and said he will continue working hard to help the team win the league title next season. “Joining Orlando Pirates was a great honour for me and it still is. Wearing the jersey is an unbelievable experience,” Mlambo said. “Ever since I’m here, I’ve learnt a lot from the coaches, the technical team and the club’s supporters. “It is an honour to be part of such a great family and I’m really grateful to be given such an opportunity to play among such talented individuals.” Since his move to the club, Mlambo has taken his opportunity with both hands. “Winning the award is great, but to be honest any of the team could have deserved it because we all put in a good shift. “The youngster Siphumelele Mbulu did great, he also deserved to be nominated for the award. “Thabo Qalinge did well on defence as well. I can’t go into every detail but everyone really put in a lot of effort. Mlambo is aware that he can’t rest on his laurels, especially at a team like Pirates, where competition is tough and has vowed to continue working hard to keep his place in the starting line-up next season. “I joined the club in the second half of the season and for a Soweto kid it was a dream come true.” -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@afrotone.co.za
