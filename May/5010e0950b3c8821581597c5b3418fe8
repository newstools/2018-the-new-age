Misfiring giants Al Ahly, in-form TP Mazembe and interesting and challenging names were talking points after matchday 2 of the CAF Champions League this week. AFP Sport also spotlights a consistent scorer from Swaziland who puts club success before personal glory. Record eight-time champions Ahly of Egypt are the only club who have failed to score during the first two rounds, partly due to weak finishing by young South African Phakamani Mahlambi. Another factor has been the absence of injured first-choice strikers Moroccan Walid Azaro and Nigerian Junior Ajayi for the draw with Esperance of Tunisia and loss to KCCA of Uganda. TP Mazembe of the Democratic Republic of Congo, who have been champions five times, are the only team with a 100 percent record after two rounds. Having started with a 4-1 hammering of Entente Setif of Algeria, the Ravens triumphed 2-0 away to Difaa el Jadida of Morocco with star striker Ben Malango among the goals. Most attackers dream of being the leading scorer in a competition, but  Felix Badenhorst of co-Group D leaders Mbabane Swallows of Swaziland insists he is not. “It is not about the Golden Boot, but winning matches,” he said after scoring the goal that gave his club a 1-0 victory over Primeiro Agosto. Group-phase debutants Township Rollers of Botswana boast a number of players in their squad with interesting names. ‘Ocean’ and ‘Flight’ are some of the first names and the surnames include ‘Boy’, ‘More’ and ‘Nato’. Angolan commentators must be grateful that most footballers in the Portuguese-speaking country prefer Brazil-style nicknames. The real name of veteran Primeiro Agosto midfielder Geraldo is Hermenegildo da Costa Paulo Bartolomeu. -AFP
