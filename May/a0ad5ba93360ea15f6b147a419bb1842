Kaizer Chiefs Chairman, Kaizer Motaung has sent his condolences following the passing of former Amakhosi strongman Jack Chamangwana (61). The Black Stone, as Chamangwana was fondly known to the Amakhosi faithful, played for Chiefs between 1986 until 1988 and later took over as coach in 1989. According to the Malawian website malawi24.com, Chamangwana died on Sunday after being admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital suffering from high blood pressure. Motaung said that the team had achieved a lot of success during Chamangwana’s tenure as both a player and a coach. “Who would forget the championship winning year of 1989? Black Stone was there as our coach,” Motaung said. He said during Chamangwana’s visit to South Africa last year, he shared his soccer knowledge and said he watched every Kaizer Chiefs match on TV. At the time of his death, The Black Stone was a Technical Director at the Malawian outfit, Be Forward Wanders FC. The Black Stone represented the senior Malawian national team, popularly known as The Flames, 133 times, which made him the second most capped Malawian player after Kinnah Phiri. -Afro Reporter
