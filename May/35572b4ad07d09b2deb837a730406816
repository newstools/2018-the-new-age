THE South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) said it was disgusted by the passing of the minimum wage bill by Parliament. Deputy general secretary Moleko Phakedi said they were not surprised the ANC-led government went ahead and passed the law even though it had been rejected by other unions and civil society. “The ANC used its majority to pass the poverty national minimum wage bill and the amendments of labour relations and basic conditions of employment act which we believe will threaten the workers constitutional right to strike,” he said. Phakedi said the ruling party was captured by white monopoly capitalists who had no interest in the workers. “We have taken note of this bill, we are going to continue to mobilise our members, unite the workers. We are going to announce three days of full national action that will bring to the fore the issues of the workers. “Now that the bill is done in Parliament, we will be going to the National Council of Provinces to march against it,” he said. The national minimum wage bill of R20 an hour is expected to see wages rise for 6.4 million workers who will now be entitled to the hourly minimum wage and at least four hours of work a shift. Farm workers will also see their wages rise to R18 an hour while domestic workers are entitled to R15 an hour. Meanwhile, Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla said they welcomed the passing of the bill as it would change the lives of lowly paid workers. “There is no way that someone who earns less than R20 an hour would reject the amount. “We are talking about the people who are earning below the minimum. This is about farm workers and vulnerable people,” he said. Portfolio committee chairperson of labour Sharome van Schalkwyk said workers must now know their rights. She urged workers to stand up against employers who wanted to pay them less than the minimum wage. -TIISETSO MANOKO|tiisetsom@afrotone.co.za
