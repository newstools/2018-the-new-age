ANC Treasure-General Paul Mashatile has described the late party veteran and former SABC Board Chairperson Eddie Funde as one of the bravest men to have ever joined the ANC. Mashatile said Funde joined the ANC when it was not fashionable and amounted to one signing their own death warrant. He was giving a keynote address at the funeral of the late veteran in Bryanston Methodist Church, north of Johannesburg. Funde died last week at the age of 75 after encountering a cardiac arrest at his home. President Cyril Ramaphosa declared an official national funeral for Funde. “The void he leaves will be difficult for the movement to fill. “We are saddened by comrade Eddie’s passing as he was a committed cadre of the movement and a selfless servant of the people to the end,” Mashatile said He said the ANC and Funde’s family have lost one of the most dedicated and committed comrades that South Africa has ever seen. “Like a true soldier, ambassador Eddie was always the one to occupy the trenches in the fight against the apartheid regime to fight for freedom and equality.” Funde was the ANC representative in Australia and New Zealand from 1983 to 1989, and also chaired the SABC board between 2004 and 2008. He will be buried at Fourways Memorial Park Cemetery. -Afro Voice Reporter
