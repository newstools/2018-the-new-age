The Parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has ordered acting CEO, Abraham Mahlangu to look into the matter of personal security that was offered to KwaZulu-Natal’s regional manager Pearl Bhengu and former Minister Bathabile Dlamini’s spokesperson Lumka Oliphant since 2012. The committee also requested Mahlangu to supply it with the amount of money that Sassa has spent on the security thus far. This comes after it has found that Security Agency of South Africa (Sassa) had been paying for private security for its KwaZulu-Natal’s regional manager Bengu and Oliphant. Sassa officials could not provide clear explanations as to why the department had to pay for the security of the set individuals and their children. The department had spent R3.5 million on protection services for Dlamini, Oliphant and their children since 2012. The committee also lambasted Bhengu for flouting supply chain processes when the department planned its three events, which amounted to R4 million each. “The committee raised concerns with the fact that the former acting Chief Executive Officer of Sassa, Ms Pearl Bhengu, speedily approved the request for these events. She did this without the three quotes required and it is apparent that prices were inflated for the services that were required. “Scopa has noted the commitments made by the current acting CEO, Mr Abraham Mahlangu and the new Minister, Ms Susan Shabangu, that there will be action taken against officials where necessary and, where applicable, monies will be recovered,” the committee said. -Afro Voice Reporter
