Cameroon-born Washington Redskins offensive left guard Arie Kouandjio could miss the 2018 NFL season after suffering a torn quadriceps tendon, although the team awaits a second medical analysis. Redskins coach Jay Gruden said Friday that the first report on his injury appeared to confirm the worst but the team will examine an MRI and seek another medical opinion before deciding the 26-year-old blocker’s fate for the upcoming campaign. “We’re going to get a second opinion. That’s a first report,” Gruden said. “We’re going to check out his quad tendon. (A tear) was the fear. But you’ve got to get it checked out so you know for sure.” Kouandjio was drafted by the Redskins in 2015 and played two seasons before joining the Baltimore Ravens practice squad, from which he was signed by Washington last year and started six games. Kouandjio, who joined his parents immigrating to the United States from Cameroon at age eight in 1998 and became a US citizen in 2016, was expected to compete for a starting spot this season but a torn quad could sideline him for eight months. -AFP
