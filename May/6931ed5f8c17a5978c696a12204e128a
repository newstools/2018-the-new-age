Mvela League outfit Black Leopards are just one win away from safely securing their return to the Premier Soccer League(PSL). Lidoda Duvha, as Leopards is popularly known plays Jomo Cosmos in their second leg of the dreaded playoffs at Thohoyandou in Venda this afternoon. Last time the two traded blows at Olen Park Stadium, they played to a thrilling 2- all draw, with Zambian marksman Mwape Musonda scoring both goals for Leopards while Rotshidzwa Muleka and midfielder Denzil Haose scoring both goals for Ezenkosi. Leopards currently lead the log with five points followed by Cosmos with two. A win will see Ezinkosi tied with Leopards on five points, making its last encounter with Platinum Stars on Saturday, June 2 a must win to threaten Lidoda Duvha’s spot in the lucrative league. Stars who were given a lifeline to redeem their shocking showing last season are strong favourites to follow Ajax Cape Town who suffered automatic relegation to the dreaded First Division after the PSL disciplinary committee docked points from the team. Dikwena has failed to win a single match in the playoffs and the team is seen as having already accepted its fate of campaigning in the tougher first division next season. They face Cosmos in the last match of the playoffs on Saturday, June at Vosloorus Stadium. -AfroVoice Reporter
