THE Pan Africanist Congress of Azania says it will continue to stand by athletics star Caster Semenya in the midst of the controversial gender rules from International Association of Athletes Federations (IAAF). “She is an example of African excellence, she is that shining Black diamond which provokes other people who do not support it,” the party said. The party applauded Prof Steve Cornelius who was part of the international athletics body, for resigning in protest of the rules. Spokesperson Kenneth Mokgatlhe said, however, that a resignation was only the first step as they called on Cornelius, to be available to help the country by representing Semenya and fight racist and sexist IAAF. “We deem the amendments of regulations by IAAF as not only racist but as sexist. We are worried as the PAC as that organisation is for some time now suffering from credibility and it will be difficult to foster or restore it,” he said. This according to Mokgatlhe was similar to what was done to Sarah Baartman who was treated like an animal, with Europeans mocking African people. “They deemed her unusual and therefore regarded her as a sub-human or half-human. Enough is enough, it must stop now,” he said. He said that there was nothing wrong with Semenya her only mistake was that she was born in Africa, this he said should stop and that the powers that be should accept that she had worked hard to be an elite athlete. –HLONI MASHIGO|hlonim@afrotone.co.za
