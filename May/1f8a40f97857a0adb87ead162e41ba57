North West Provincial Chairperson Supra Mahumapelo has resigned as premier of the province. Mahumapelo said the reason for his resignation is because he does not want to hinder any processes of investigation in relation to torching down of houses in places like Mafikeng and Taung. “If all these investigations are taking place in my presence, it will be very difficult to avoid the accusation that I’m using political power. I don’t want to be seen as getting back at people, as I have been accused of corruption,” he said. Mahumapelo said he is not a political self-preservation activist, adding that the revolution came first as well as the country. “We want to remind you that one of the most important resolutions at the conference was that the ANC must lead society in making sure we intensify the struggle against greed, crime and corruption.” The embattled provincial chairperson said one of the things his organisation needed to do going forward is to do policial education of ANC branches. Mahumapelo’s demise started when the province embarked on a violent protest in Mahikeng and surrounding areas with residents accusing him of corruption and calling for him to vacate his position as Premier. Earlier in the month, his supporters stormed the Provincial Executive (PEC) meeting, which was set to decide his fate as the Premier. He, however, appealed to his supporters to be patient and allow the ongoing meeting to conclude. “I am requesting you to give us the opportunity for me to address the PEC, and then the whole PEC will address you,” Mahumapelo said. -Afro Voice Reporter
