Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip has survived yet another motion of no confidence against him on Thursday after the opposition, EFF, UDM and the AIC withdrew the motion. The motion was brought against Trollip by the EFF. It is currently unclear why the motion has been withdrawn by the coalition of opposition parties. This is the third time the motion fails to proceed after a council sitting to deal with a motion against Trollip was indefinitely postponed last month after chaos broke out in the council sitting.

But every time we convene to have it done, they pull out,” said Trollip to Power FM on Thursday morning. ”I’m certainly not going anywhere,” He added that he was waiting for the council to sit so that they can ‘win it’ and continue to do the important business of running the city. The mayor was confident he would survive the motion citing that the ANC had also lost numbers as two of its members who were present for the two previous motions would not participate this time.
