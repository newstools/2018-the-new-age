Police spokesperson Brig Mathapelo Peters said they were still waiting for the post-mortem to be finalised in order to determine what caused the death of 10-year-old autistic Katlego Joja, whose body was found floating in Moretele River, Mamelodi, last week. “At this point, we are uncertain how Katlego died. We have opened an inquest docket and once we know what the postmortem says that’s when we will know whether she was killed and we will start to look for suspects,” Peters said. Gauteng Premier David Makhura has assured Katlego’s family that the best police investigators were trying to ensure that her killers were brought to book. He and health MEC Dr. Gwen Ramokgopa visited the family on Sunday. Katlego was reported missing on May 3 and three days later her family was called to identify her body found in Mamelodi D2 section. Referring to reports that the police had not acted immediately after Katlego was reported missing, Makhura said he was very angry about this. “When an institution fails our citizens, it breaks my heart. I am deeply hurt by the loss of Katli and very angry about the treatment the Joja family received from the Mamelodi SAPS. “We would like to see an immediate change of leadership at the station,” Makhura said. Katlego, who was only starting to understand social nuances such as smiling recently, loved singing even though she barely spoke. Last week community safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane visited the family and shared the preliminary findings of the post-mortem report. She said disciplinary action against those who were on shift when the case was reported was already underway. Some police officers are suspended. The police officers apparently turned the family away twice before opening a case and even sent them on a wild goose chase, claiming they had found a lead on the case. -SHONISANI TSHIKALANGE
