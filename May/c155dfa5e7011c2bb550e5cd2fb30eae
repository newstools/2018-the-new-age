North West police have expressed joy over the decision made by the North Gauteng High Court on Thursday to give Kobus Koekemoer and his wife Louisa Koekemoer life imprisonment sentences for murder. The sentence came after Kobus’ arrest in October 2016 for murder and child abuse of his 4-year old step-daughter Poppie Van Der Merwe. According to reports, the accused assaulted his step-daughter a several times at their home in Mamogaleskraal near Brits and she was taken to the hospital where she was declared dead on arrival. Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Baile Motswenyane said the accused’s wife was arrested in December 2016 on the order of the court, charging her as an accomplice to murder. Motswenyane commended Brits Detectives Investigating Team for a sterling job and ensuring that the culprits get maximum sentences. “The sentence will serve as a deterrence to potential criminals including those who commit crimes against women and children.” -Afro Voice Reporter
