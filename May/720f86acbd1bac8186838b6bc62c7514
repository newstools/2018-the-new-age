Political commentator Moeletsi Mbeki has reiterated that the ANC and EFF’s call for land expropriation without compensation is an attempt to boost its campaign and get votes in the upcoming elections. Mbeki initially made the comments during a discussion at the Nampo Harvest Day in Bothaville last week where he referred to EFF leader Julius Malema as a ‘black racist’. Mbeki says that the reason the ANC wants to implement  land expropriation is because, “In their last election, its votes was down to 54%, it is staring defeat in the eye, which is why it is now fishing around for all sorts of sensational policies that it thinks will make the population will vote for it…but nobody wants this land,” Mbeki told Power FM. According to Mbeki, the majority of people in SA do not want agricultural land as two-thirds of the South African population in urban areas, therefore, they don’t want agriculture land. He said that the EFF and ANC were using a ‘propaganda’ to tell South Africans that if they vote for them, they will expropriate land. Meanwhile, ANC NEC member Ronald Lamola said that the issue of land had been within the ANC’s mandate since the party was formed. He denied this being an attack on white people as Mbeki says. “From our view, it is not an attack on any white person when you are expropriating land that is there lying that is not being used as we speak. “Is not like we have woken up and just said from December, we are going to chase away white people. That allegation is unfounded, it’s misplaced,” Lamola said. -Afro Reporter
