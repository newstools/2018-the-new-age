LAST year TV personality Bonang Matheba gave her fans a glimpse into her stylish and lavish lifestyle, through her reality show, Being Bonang on Vuzu Amp now known as 1Magic (DStv 103). The first episode of the second season debuted to much fanfare and social media frenzy on Friday. The first episode comes just a week after US reality star of The Real Housewives of Atlanta Porsha Williams indicated her excitement over the show via social media. “It’s exciting and quite flattering, Porsha and I met digitally, and we have been following each others careers quite closely,” Matheba told Afro Voice in a recent interview. Matheba says so much has happened between last year and the start of the new year and aims to bring the truth of her life closer to her fans. “So much has happened since the first season of Being Bonang. I’ve entered my 30s and not only have I moved and pushed my brand globally, but I have also changed and amended my personal perspectives on life. I’m super excited to share these moments with my fans,” Matheba said. She was recently invited to celebrate the inspirational life of Madiba as the MC of the Global Gift Nelson Mandela Centenary dinner, one of London’s most distinguished annual charity events. Season one was aired when Matheba was still dating rapper, AKA. She is now single and hopefully she will be able to shed light to the much publicised breakup through the show. The channel says they decided to bring season two after positive feedback from fans. The new season will pick up from the frenzy of the first but with a new crew. “We are excited to have Bonang return to our channel for a second season of the reality show, Being Bonang,” M-Net director of local channels Reneilwe Sema said. -SIYABONGA SITHOLE|siyabongas@afrotone.co.za
