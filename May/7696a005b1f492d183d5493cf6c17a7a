The Portfolio Committee on Basic Education has called on the police to leave no stone unturned when investigating the alleged failed hit on National Teachers’ Union (NATU) Deputy President Allen Thompson. In a statement issued by NATU president Siphosethu Ngcobo, Thompson was attacked while on his way to Durban by heavily armed men who wore balaclavas on Friday afternoon. According to Ngcobo his deputy was shot in the shoulder through the window of his car and continued driving with the assailants chasing him “with the intention of killing him”. Thompson was allegedly followed to the Netcare Umhlanga hospital and after unsuccessfully searching for him, the assailants allegedly then went and searched his car where they left with two laptops that allegedly contained critical information regarding the investigation into education into education in the province. His wallet and the car were allegedly left despite the key being in the ignition. In April, Natu announced that millions of rands were spent by the Department of Basic Education in KwaZulu-Natal on procuring substandard sanitary towels. On Monday, Committee Chairperson Nomalungelo Gina said media reports regarding the alleged ambush must be condemned in the harshest possible terms. She said it was even more concerning that after firing on Thompson, the attackers allegedly followed him into the hospital in an attempt to finish what they had started. “This is criminality at its worst. No stone should be left unturned in finding the culprits and bringing them to book,” She also called on the authorities to ensure that the alleged attackers are apprehended speedily, as they pose a danger to society. According to KwaZulu-Natal Police Spokesperson Nqobile Gwala, no one has been arrested regarding Thompson’s shooting. -Afro Reporter
