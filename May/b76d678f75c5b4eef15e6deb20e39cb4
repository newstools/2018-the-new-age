International celebrity fashion and beauty duo Sir John and Ty Hunter painted the town red as part of Woolworths’ intimate Beyoncé’s Glam Squad beauty session in Cape Town and Johannesburg at the weekend. The duo, who have been styling American pop singer Beyoncé for more than two decades combined, unpacked their fashion and beauty trade secrets and how they creatively conceptualise trendsetting looks for their A-list celebrity clients. Not only did they ensure a one of its kind early Mother’s Day experience, they got to mingle and share the latest and ultimate in Hollywood glamour with the who’s who of the local fashion and beauty scene, the pair treated a few lucky customers to incredible makeovers transforming them into their very own divas. South Africa’s very own Queen B, Bonang Matheba and Ayanda Thabethe did their best to ensure a smoothly executed event as the hosts. In addition to having earned the envy of their peers as Beyoncé’s long-serving glam team,
the globally renowned style mavens have helped create iconics for more stars such as Solange Knowles, Viola Davis, Kim Kardashian West, Michelle Williams, Kelly Rowland and Serena William. This creative collaboration with Woolworths was the first for the pair after the already iconic Beychella, Beyoncé’s much talked about Coachella performance that blew everyone away
