The Muslim Judicial Council (MJC) is on Tuesday expected to march to Parliament calling for the removal of Israel’s ambassador in the country (South Africa). The council is demanding that the South African government continue to place pressure on Israel to start peace negotiations with Palestine. “The massacre that happened yesterday is completely unacceptable,” the council said. Meanwhile, Minister of International Relations Lindiwe Sisulu told media on Tuesday that government needed to think carefully about what action they will be taking with regard to Israel. “We had an early warning at 12 noon, by 15:00 pm Al Jazeera was reporting deaths and by 17:00 pm I met with President Ramaphosa to decide on an action,” Sisulu said. She, however, said the focal point for her department was the economy adding that in October South Africa will host an international investor summit hoping to raise R1 trillion. The government yesterday recalled its Ambassador in Israel, Sisa Ngombane, after dozens of Palestinians were killed in a deadly attack in the Gaza Strip. The move was not the first time the government has recalled its ambassador in Israel. Eight years ago then ambassador Ismail Coovadia, was recalled after nine people were killed during a violent confrontation between Israeli troops and Palestinian activists. At the time government said his recall was temporary. -Afro Worldview Reporter
