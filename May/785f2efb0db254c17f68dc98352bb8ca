The City of Cape Town together with Prasa and the Western Cape government have on Thursday signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) to form a dedicated enforcement unit to focus on safety and security for Metrorail commuters and infrastructure. This follows a commitment that the city and other stakeholders made to improve the infrastructure and security of the railway during the rail summit that took place in February. Among others, the summit was attended by the city’s Transport and Urban Development Authority, the Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works, rail experts and business leaders. The city said that the MOA will address how the dedicated enforcement unit will be funded, established and managed. “The cost to establish and operate the unit for a period of 12 months is approximately R47,9 million and will be jointly funded by the TDA, the Western Cape Government and PRASA. It is foreseen that the unit will be operational within the next two to three months.” Prasa’s acting Group Executive Lindikaya Zide said that the agency is confident that rail commuters will benefit from an increased focus on safety. Metrorail Western Cape Regional Manager Richard Walker said that it was apparent at the summit that the stakeholder collaboration and resource integration is a more effective way of tackling issues that have an impact on all modes of public transport. “This initiative will support and assist in expediting our PRASA plans to professionalise and transform our own Protection Services Department to a more effective, better skilled and equipped transit-oriented unit to combat crime,” Walker said. The city has also made a commitment to appoint and train the law enforcement officers for the initiative. -Afro Voice Reporter
