Disgraced convicted former Western Cape Police chief Arno Lamoer and two of his former colleagues have decided not to appeal the lengthy jail sentences handed to them by the Western Cape High court last week. This comes after they initially indicated last week that they intended filing to appeal the lengthy jail sentences handed down by Judge Rosheni Allie. The four, including former brigadiers Daruis van der Ross and Colin Govender, as well as businessman Saleem Dawjee were released on R10000 bail each on Friday after a successful plea to challenge judge Rosheni Allie’s decision. They now have until midday to hand themselves over at the Malmesbury Correctional Center where they will start serving their sentences. Lamoer and car towing business owner Saleem Dawjee were both sentenced to eight years jail sentence, with two years suspended after Lamoer admitted to receiving gratifications worth thousands of rands from Dawjee. Darius van Der Ross was handed an effective two-year imprisonment, while and Colin Govender received an effective four jail sentence. Meanwhile, Dawjee has indicated that he intended continuing with his application for leave to appeal the six-year sentence imposed on him. Meanwhile, the Asset Forfeiture Unit said it was going to launch an application for a confiscation order against the group to recover the stolen funds. The AFU is seeking R67000 from Lamoer, R3000 from Van der Ross and more than R24000 from Govender. Van der Ross also admitted having used Dawjee’s petrol cards to fill up his car on several occasions for amounts totaling R3 324. National police commissioner Gen Khehla John Sitole welcomed the sentencing of the former police officers, saying as disconcerting as these convictions and sentencing may seem, people of South Africa were urged to view this outcome positively. -Afro Reporter with additional reporting by VINCENT CRUYWAGEN
