Convicted former African National Congress (ANC) Youth League Deputy president and councillor Andile Lungisa has been sentenced to two years behind bars by the Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court on Wednesday. Lungisa was found guilty of assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm last month by the same court for assaulting a mayoral committee member for transport, Rano Kayser during a parliamentary sitting. Lungisa has been sentenced to three years imprisonment for assault with one year suspended for five years. He will effectively serve two years behind bars.   A video showing him smashing a glass full of water on Kayserâ€™s head was widely circulated on social media following the incident. He previously pleaded not guilty to the charges and said that his actions were done out of self-defence. -Afro Reporter
