The National Union of Public Service and Allied Workers (NUPSAW) said on Tuesday that it rejects the Public Service salary agreement and vows not to sign for it in its current form. “NUPSAW will not sign Public Service salary agreement in its current form as it discriminates our level 8-12 members against the rest of the members, especially in subsequent years. This decision was adopted by the Independent Labour Caucus (ILC) and we believe it was the right decision.” The union is in disagreement with the Public Service Department’s offer for a 7% salary increase for entry level and a 6.6% and 6% increase for mid and senior-level staff. The union further says that it will not sign the agreement as it also again takes away the members rights to a housing allowance. The agreement was presented to the unions to sign on Monday where Cosatu affiliates are alleged to agreed to sign for it, while the Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) is still to engage its members on the matter. Meanwhile, the Minister for Public Service and Administration Ayanda Dlodlo said that government would not further engage in these wage negotiations. “We are not going to renegotiate. We finalised, we signed on the dotted line yesterday. So for us, there is very little room for us to manoeuvre out of this, so we are just hoping that the unions will come on board with us,” she said -AfroVoice Reporter
