THE upcoming Soweto Fashion Week (SFW) will honour the legacy left by Winnie Madikizela-Mandela as the local fashion extravaganza returns to its former home, Walter Sisulu Hall in Kliptown, the heart of South Africa’s iconic township Soweto. Taking place from May 30 to June 2, this four-day fashion fair will kick off with a pre-launch party on May 30 at the Soweto Hotel. Speaking to Afro Voice, Soweto Fashion Week founder Stephen Manzini said he and his team have come a long way since the early days and he characterised a lot of challenges in the first two fashion week events. “We have come a long way from those days and I am proud to say some of our talented designers have gone on to do bigger and better things with their careers and have consistently competed with some of the designers found in the biggest fashion weeks in the country.” “This year’s Autumn Season SFW is particularly special as we will be, over and above all the showcases, honouring the spirit of the Mother of our Nation, the legendary Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who was an iconic fashion figure and a great inspiration for the people of Soweto,” he said. Manzini said with more than 25 young designers from Soweto as well as other African countries, the focus still remains to make SFW the ideal platform for promoting authentic Africa within cutting-edge clothing and accessory designs. “More than 25 young designers from countries such as Swaziland,will be showcasing their Autumn Winter collections and some of the original designs to be shown are specifically inspired by Winnie Mandela’s own personal fashion style and preferences – in every aspect from colour palettes to clothing and accessory styles,” he said. This year’s Autumn designs will be on show along with those of 24 other enigmatic, energetic, talented and inspired designers, whose work will be showcased by a total of 75 models – including 30 male models, 30 “petite female” models and 15 “plus size” models. Besides celebrating the legacy of Madikizela-Mandela with iconic Mpondo-inspired headwraps, Manzini said the show would also showcase works from two exceptionally-talented young designers who really made a splash during the 2017 Season, Mercia Ramagaga and The Klossete who were featured in last year’s SFW had their designs subsequently incorporated into Young Designer Emporium Stores nationwide. siyabongas@afrotone.co.za
