African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Ace Magashule says his party will soon have a clear direction of how to proceed with expropriation of land without compensation. While addressing members of the media on Tuesday at the party’s headquarters in Johannesburg Magashule said it was only a matter of time before the party had a definite programme for the land question. “In two months the ANC will have a clear program of action on land with clear timelines in terms of delivery,” ” The ANC will push ahead for the parliamentary process on land reform swiftly and form an expert panel on agrarian reform and test the constitution in court in terms of expropriation without consultation,” he said. Magashule further said the National Executive Committee (NEC), has decided to double their efforts in trying to restore historical injustices and ensure the correct implementation of land reform. The party’s Secretary General said the ANC will further engage with traditional leaders who remain a “motive force” for the ANC. During its 54th National conference, the party adopted land expropriation without compensation as its policy. At the time the party wanted to amend Section 25 of the Constitution in order to allow the state to expropriate land without compensation but it has not set a deadline.  -AfroVoice Reporter
