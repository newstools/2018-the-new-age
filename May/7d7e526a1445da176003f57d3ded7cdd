An alleged serial rapist will appear at the Hermanus Court in Cape Town on Monday. This follows his arrest for allegedly sexually assaulting eleven victims. Regional police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said that between September 2015 and March 2018 the 29-year-old has been allegedly operating in Zwelihle, Hermanus area. “In March 2016 the dockets were handed over to the Serial and Electronic Crimes Investigations (SECI) FCS units for further investigations, and found that at the time there were five cases with the same modus operandi.” Van Wyk said that all the cases were linked with the same DNA, however, the identity of the suspect was unknown. All his victims reportedly said that the suspect approached them while they were walking alone, using a knife to force them to walk with him to a deserted area known as ‘MOP’ where he robbed and raped them. In most cases, victims said that the suspect had a balaclava or stockings over his face which made identifying him more difficult. Van Wyk said that in April the suspect was spotted at the MOP where he was arrested and detained. “He was found in possession of a balaclava, a stocking and a knife.” However, the suspect was released due to lack of evidence. “Fortunately a buccal swab was taken from him and sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory and the DNA result linked him to 11 cases.” The alleged rapist is still in custody. -Afro Voice Reporter
