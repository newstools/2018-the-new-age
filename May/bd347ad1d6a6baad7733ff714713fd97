A 38-year-old traditional healer in Sekhukhune who was convicted for raping two minor girls, one of them a five-year-old in separate incidents, was given double life sentences by the Nebo Regional Court outside Jane Furse last week. The court heard that the man, whose identity has been withheld to protect the minor victims, one of whom one is his relative, raped a 10-year-old girl in 2014. He found her playing with her cousin and sent the cousin to the shop to buy some items. He then called the 10-year old into his bedroom where he undressed and raped her. After that, he gave her R15 and warned her that he would kill her if she disclosed to anyone about their sexual intercourse. In the second incident, which occurred in 2015, the traditional healer invited the five-year-old girl, his close relative, to his house under the pretext he wanted to send her to the shop. He then took her to his bedroom and raped her. “During the trial, the accused denied the allegations against him. His defence was ultimately rejected by the court and was found guilty as charged,” the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) provincial spokesperson Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi said. Arguing in aggravation of sentence, state prosecutor Johannes Rampedi submitted that the ordeals had impacted negatively on the two girls. Rampedi said the healer betrayed the trust the two children had in him and should, therefore, be sentenced to life imprisonment on each count of rape. The court concurred and found that there were no substantial and compelling circumstances to justify a lesser sentence. Magistrate MJ Motubatsi said the healer did not have respect for his family and relatives and sentenced him to double life imprisonment. The magistrate also ordered that the healer’s name be entered into the National Register for Sexual Offenders. -MONTSHO MATLALA
