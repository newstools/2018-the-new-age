THE ANC has accused the DA of using the deaths of mentally ill patients in the Life Esidimeni tragedy as cannon fodder in its conflict with the ruling party – ahead of today’s motion of no confidence against Gauteng Premier David Makhura. ANC provincial secretary Hope Papo described the DA’s usage of the Life Esidimeni scandal involving the deaths of 143 people at psychiatric facilities in the province to oust Makhura as “bad politics”. “The victims must be compensated and consoled and not become the political football of a party called the DA. “The attempts to use the tragedy of Life Esidimeni is bad politics and using Life Esidimeni for the 2019 elections when people have died, is bad politics,” Papo said. Makhura added said the DA had its own problems to worry about. “They have a lot of issues they must solve among themselves. They think we are stupid and that we’ll be sidetracked,” Makhura said. “They are grappling with the national question of race that and it is dividing them. “Any party that wants to win the support of the people of South Africa must stand for substantive transformation, they can’t agree on that. “They can agree on the fact that in this country black people have been put back by a system that has many manifestations. They can’t agree to that.” The DA’s Jack Bloom said the premier should take political responsibility and step down. “The DA believes that proper accountability and responsibility for the deaths of so many vulnerable people is for the provincial government, especially the premier, to step down,” Bloom said. The DA is calling for Makhura’s head for his role in the Esidimeni scandal. Retired deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke ruled that the Gauteng government pay each family of the deceased R20000 for funeral expenses‚ R180000 for psychological trauma and R1m in constitutional damages. -BONOLO SELEBANO|bonolos@afrotone.co.za
