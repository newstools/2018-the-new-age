The city is supporting a pilot project that is training 42 unemployed youth and placing them with businesses in the business process outsourcing (BPO) sector. The city of Cape Town was looking at further supporting the project based on the outcomes of this pilot, mayor Patricia de Lille said. She visited the innovative Zoe Incubation Academy in Delft this week where young Capetonians were being trained at the first community-based call centre in Cape Town. The incubation academy is creating a steady pipeline of highly skilled individuals who can be placed in any call centre across the city. The BPO sector is one of the fastest growing and biggest job creators in Cape Town. The BPO industry creates 51 300 jobs in the province, with most of these opportunities located in the city. The city has made R1m available to the pilot project through a partnership with the Business Process Enabling South Africa Western Cape (BPeSA WC). De Lille said this state-of-the-art academy and call centre had the potential to disrupt the BPO sector with its innovative approach to technology and decentralised call centre, which was located closer to where people live rather than requiring expensive office space. “A project like this not only addresses our country’s high unemployment rate, poverty and other social ills but it has the potential to tap into Cape Town’s fast-growing fibre network and unlocking opportunities in communities not often thought of as leaders in tech innovation,” De Lille said. “To tap into this digital revolution, the city must assist our youth to position themselves to take advantage of our economy’s growing sectors. This will create a more inclusive city.’’ She further said this project was just one of many initiatives the city was running in support of the BPO industry. Other initiatives included the collaboration between the city of Cape Town, the provincial government and the BPeSA WC. -nadinef@afrotone.co.za
