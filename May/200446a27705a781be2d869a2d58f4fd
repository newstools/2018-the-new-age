A second Palestinian was killed by Israeli fire along the Gaza border Monday, the Gazan health ministry said, as protests and clashes intensified against the US transfer of its embassy to Jerusalem. Musaab Abu Leila, 29, was shot dead east of Jabalia in northern Gaza, the ministry said, shortly after a 21-year-old was killed in the south of the strip. Thousands gathered in five spots along the border in protest at the embassy move, while sporadic clashes also erupted with Israeli soldiers. AFP
