Murder accused Sbonelo Mkhize will appear in the Durban Magistrate Court tomorrow where he is expected to make his bail application. Mkhize, who stands accused of killing nine-year-old Sadia Sukhraj, made a brief appearance in Court on Wednesday this after his appearance had to be moved from the Chatsworth Magistrates Court due to security concerns. Anger erupted in the community of Chatsworth when on Monday morning Sukhraj died after being caught up in a shootout between armed hijackers and her father outside their home. While appearing in court Mkhize claimed that he was assaulted by members of the community and the police on Monday during his arrest at the Chatsworth Police Station and Durban Central. His request to be detained at the Westville Prison for his safety was granted by the court. 20 members of the Chatsworth have been arrested since protests erupted. Yesterday scores of mourners turned up for Sukhrajâ€™s funeral service at the Christian Revival Centre in Chatsworth including Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane. Meanwhile, Police Minister Bheki Cele is expected to visit the Sukhraj family on Thursday after visiting the Chatsworth Police Station for an update on the investigation. -AfroVoice Reporter
