The Democratic Alliance (DA) has welcomed President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement that he would appoint a commission of inquiry into the South African Revenue Service (Sars) investigation. The DA said the revenue service under the suspended commissioner Tom Moyane’s tenure had degenerated from a world-class tax collection agency into a ‘captured’ institution beholden to Jacob Zuma and his band of corrupt cadres. The party was responding to Ramaphosa’s announcement during the Presidency’s budget vote on Wednesday that he would be appointing the commision which will be chaired by Judge Robert Nugent, who will be assisted by Michael Katz, Mabongi Masilo and Vuyo Kahla. Nugent is appointed after Moyane’s lawyers raised their objection with former Constitutional Court Justice Kate O’Regan, who they said as a member of NGO Corruption Watch may not be a neutral person. DA Shadow Deputy Minister of Finance Alf Lees said Moyane has not only acted at variance with his responsibilities as Sars Commissioner but caused enormous damage to the economy and the loss of jobs by delaying the refunds of taxes and also played a predominant role in the revenue shortfall of R 50 billion in 2017/18. “The DA urges the Commission of Inquiry to start its work without delay and to work swiftly and diligently to ensure that it produces a comprehensive and productive report,” Lees said. He said the appointment of the commission soon after the appointment of Mark Kingon as acting commissioner are essential steps towards the restoration of sanity at the tax revenue service. -Afro Voice Reporter
