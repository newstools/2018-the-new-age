Among the chosen 12 is Thandokazi Mfundisi, a domestic violence abuse survivor tugged at the heartstrings of guests who attended the event as she shared her story and her plans to use her experience to help other women who were in a similar situation. She said should she win the Miss SA title she would use it fight the spate of violence against women in South Africa that had gripped the country. Speaking to Afro Voice, Mfundisi said with her law degree she planned to advocate for women rights. “With the increase in the number of women dying at the hands of their loved ones. I want to be part of the solution to the heartbreaking conditions women were subjected to,” she said. The East London swan who also caught the attention of many for her natural short hair said: “I actually have a collection of wigs but I feel confident and extremely beautiful with my natural hair, I mean look at my cheekbones darling how could I dare hide them.” Another favourite is Noxolo Ndebele from Kwa-Nongoma in KwaZulu-Natal. She said the Miss SA stage is a dream come true for her. “I grew up in the rural areas and I aim to inspire other girls from small towns and rural areas who want to make it big in the world,” she said. -NONTOKOZO GXUMISA
