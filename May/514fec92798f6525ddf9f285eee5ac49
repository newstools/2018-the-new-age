Transport and Allied Workers’ Union (SATAWU) national coordinator Solomon Mahlangu says that unions will meet with employers on Monday to negotiate the implementation of back-payment. The unions met on Friday where they agreed on a number of demands with employers. They accepted an offer of 9% increase for the first year and an 8% increase in the second year. However, they failed to agree on the implementation date of the increase. The unions are demanding that the increase must be back-dated to April 1 as per ‘industry tradition’. Speaking to Afro Worldview on Monday, Mahlangu said that “we have an industry agreement and an industry tradition that says that the implementation date is the first of April. After we had come to a point where we about to have an agreement the employers decided to shift the goal post again to say they will not implement this agreement according to our principle. They will implement on the date of signing the agreement which is the 11th [May], and we disagreed with them,” Mahlangu said that they could not agree on the implementation date as it was not the worker’s fault to delay the negotiations but a result of both parties engaging in negotiations. The unions will meet on Monday afternoon to resolve the ongoing strike which has lasted a month with most bus operations being suspended. -Afro Reporter
