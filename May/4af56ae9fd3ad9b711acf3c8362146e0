Radio and TV personality Thando Thabethe has a new TV show coming up in June titled, Thando Bares It All. The show will see Thabethe tackling various issues that ordinary citizens go through in their daily lives, but just aren’t brave enough to talk about. The excited Thabethe said: “I have never done a show where I’m privileged to meet people who are brave enough to live such extraordinary lives, getting to speak with these people was definitely one for the books.” The 5FM DJ said she was mostly looking forward to how people would react to some of the eyebrow-raising topics, providing an opportunity for them to have a different outlook on matters and aspects of their lives. “I have been through a lot of hard times and good times in my life, I’ve had the opportunity to meet people from all over the world and travel to the most beautiful cities in the world. I think this worldly experience came in handy with having frank, open and honest conversations with my guests,” she said. The highly anticipated show will premier on Saturday on TLC (DStv 135). “It means the world that the show will broadcast all over Africa, a first for a South African production. It truly is an honour,” she said. – Nontokozo Gxumisa
