The court case of the five suspects arrested in connection with the brazen cash
heist has been postponed to 13 June by the Boksburg Magistrates Court on Monday. Four of the five gang syndicate members have yet to request bail while accused number one in the case formally requested bail. This was the gangâ€™s second appearance following a brief appearance last week amid a strong police presence as they were regarded highly dangerous. The suspects are accused
of involvement in the bombing of two cash transporting vans at Atlas Road two weeks ago. Previously the defence team of the accused told the court their clients were assaulted during their arrests. One of the suspects claimed that he was kicked, strangled and suffocated with a plastic bag because the police wanted to force confessions and statements. The accused are facing charges of robbery with aggravating circumstances, attempted murder, malicious damage to property, possession of ammunition, possession of unlicensed firearms and commercial explosives. -AfroVoice Reporter
