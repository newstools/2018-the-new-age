North West ANC has on Monday cautioned the media to ‘carefully’ report on matters that might hamper investigations into Provincial Chairperson and embattled Premier Supra Mahumapelo’s alleged assassination plot. This comes after a report by the City Press said officers who are conducting investigations on the assassination plot alleged that allegations that a hitman had been offered about R250 000 to kill Mahumapelo is believed to be ‘fake’. According to the report, the Hawks have allegedly told the paper that they were “not buying” the version presented to them by the premier’s source. “The ANC in Bokone Bophirima has noted with concern, but we are not surprised, by the City Press newspaper report headlined “Supra Death Threat Fake. We urge City Press to think very carefully before they publish stories, which may hamper sensitive investigations associated with acts of criminality, instead of chasing attention-grabbing stories that are not true,” the NW ANC said in a statement. The ANC says that it sees this as an attempt to divert the attention of law enforcement agencies. This would not be the first time the premiers’ life was threatened, last year, a former ANC councillor accused of plotting to kill Mahumapelo was sentenced to five years imprisonment by the Lehurutshe Magistrate’s Court. “The courts in this country have already found guilty two people who made an attempt on the Provincial Chairperson’s life,” said the ANC. The recent case of conspiracy to commit murder was opened at the Mahikeng Police Station earlier this month. -Afro Reporter
