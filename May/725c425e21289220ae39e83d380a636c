The chairperson of the shack dwellers’ movement Abahlali baseMjondolo, S’fiso Ngcobo was gunned down by unknown gunmen on Tuesday. Ngcobo was shot and killed at his home at around 6 pm but the police were only notified of the incident by the hospital at around 11 pm in the evening. “A murder case is opened for investigation. But we appeal to the members of the community because it was not late at night when it happened, there might be people who have witnessed this, to please come forward and give the police the information,” said SAPS spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele to news channel Afro WorldView. The police said that the motive of the murder is at this stage unknown. Mbhele said that upon investigation they discovered that nothing was stolen from Ngcobo’s house. The murder has been suspected to be an assassination in the midst of the political killings in KZN. However, Mbhele said that they could not predict the motive of his murder as they were still at an earlier stage of their investigations. “We cannot predict whether its political related or not. But what I can say is that he was a strong member of Abahlali baseMjondolo in this area,” Mbhele said. We are saddened and outraged at the murder of Abahlali leader Sfiso Ngcobo, the chairperson of Abahlali baseMjondolo in eKukhayeni last night. Strength to his family and comrades. — Right2Know (@r2kcampaign) May 23, 2018  -Afro Voice Reporter
