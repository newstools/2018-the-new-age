Charges against 48 people who were arrested in connection with the torching of trucks in Mooi River, KwaZulu-Natal have been withdrawn. Fifty-six people were initially arrested when 32 trucks were burned to ashes on N3 Toll. It is believed that the protest was about the employment of foreign nationals as truck drivers. Only eight of the arrested protestors appeared at the Mooi River Magistrate’s court on Wednesday after the police could not link the 48 to the crime. Police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele said they had to release the suspects as there was no sufficient evidence to keep them in the police cells. “The arrested ones will appear again on April 7 for a formal bail application,” Mbhele said. Both carriageways had to be closed for hours in order to clear the rubble and the wreckages of the trucks. Transport Minister Blade Nzimande and KwaZulu-Natal Transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda, who visited the area to inspect the damages condemned the actions and promised that action would be taken against those who vandalise property. Kaunda said irrespective of what the people are protesting about, no one had a right to break the laws of the country and expect to get away with it. “People cant just break the law. We are calling on the community to make sure that we calm the situation so that it can return to its normality,” Kaunda said at the time. The road has now been fully reopened. -Afro Reporter
