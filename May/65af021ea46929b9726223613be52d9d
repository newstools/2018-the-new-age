Suspected killer Mark Zinde has been referred to the Weskoppies psychiatric hospital for the third time for observation. Zinde made a brief appearance at the North Gauteng High court where he is facing charges of killing his mother, former journalist and SABC board member Hope Zinde. Both the defense and state agreed that he should be sent for evaluation for the third time as it appeared that his mental state had deteriorated. He has on two previous occasions been declared fit to stand trial for his mother’s murder by a panel of psychiatrists. Zinde is accused of killing his mother at their home in Pecanwood Estate near Hartbeespoort Dam in 2016. Her body was discovered on June 11, 2016, stuffed inside the boot of her car. He is also facing charges of drug possession, assault, and attempted murder. Zinde was released on a R10 000 bail but was rearrested after allegedly assaulting his father Lebohang Manoto at his Walkerville home in Johannesburg. The case will resume again on June 3. -Afro Reporter
