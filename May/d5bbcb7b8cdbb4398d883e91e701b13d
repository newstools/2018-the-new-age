Desai is currently delivering his judgement in a case that has been going on since 2015. “The accused confirmed that he never felt insecure, unsafe or threatened while living at the Zalze Estate. “They slept with open windows without burglar bars and keys in the doors without security gates. The back-door was even left open or unlocked sometimes. “Desai said. He said the court was in agreement with the state that it was highly unlikely that the security was breached by an intruder from outside. The case continues. -Afro Reporter
