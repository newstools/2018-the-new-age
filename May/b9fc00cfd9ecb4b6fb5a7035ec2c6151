Kwazulu-Natal police have called on people who are currently being sought in connection with the vandalism of the Moses Mabhida Stadium to hand themselves over before they are arrested. The call comes after two more people handed themselves over to the police earlier today, bringing the total number of arrests to five. Both suspects will appear at the Durban Magistrates Court on Tuesday to face charges of public violence. They were arrested in connection with the vandalism at Moses Mabhida Stadium during a Nedbank Cup Semifinal match where favourites Kaizer Chiefs lost by 2-0 to Free State Stars on April 21. According to KwaZulu-Natal police Spokesperson Jay Naicker, the police recovered headphones and a cordless microphone which were both allegedly stolen at the stadium, during the arrest of a 21-year old student from Newlands West. Naicker said the second suspect was a 42-year-old gardener from Hillcrest. “We welcome that fact that suspects are beginning to contact the investigating officers in order for them to have their day in court and we are encouraging the outstanding suspects to do so immediately before police officers pounce on them,” Naicker said. The police have also called on anyone who may assist with identifying the people on the pictures that were circulated by the police on Sunday to contact Captain Reddy on 082 458 5630 or Detective Warrant Officer Mlungwana on 082 662 7764. -Afro Reporter
