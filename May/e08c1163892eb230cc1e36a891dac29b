The National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (Numsa) says the ANC led government and Cosatu leadership will go down in history as organisations that played a role in butchering the South African working class. Numsa said they rejected what they call the “right-wing Thatcherist agenda” of President Cyril Ramaphosa referring to the new minimum wage implemented by the government. “The president is using his so-called “New Dawn” to oppress and to drive the exploitation of the working class. The state has done everything possible to please business at the expense of the Black and African working class,” the union said. President Ramaphosa signed a national minimum wage agreement of R20 an hour last year in his capacity as the then Deputy President. At the time he worked with Nedlac to negotiate a national minimum wage. Numsa further said it supports the call by the South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) to intensify mass action on the ground to reverse the implementation of the “draconian laws”. This is after the bill was overwhelmingly endorsed by Members of Parliament (MP’s) on Tuesday. The bill sought to put the minimum wage at R20 an hour. MPs also passed the Basic Conditions of Employment Amendment Bill and Labour Relations Amendment Bill.  Meanwhile, Saftu general secretary Mugwena Maluleke says the majority of their members gave them the mandate to sign the wage agreement. Maluleke, however, admitted that the wage agreement was not in the “best of the best” but felt it’s the best squeeze out of government. -Afro Voice Reporter
