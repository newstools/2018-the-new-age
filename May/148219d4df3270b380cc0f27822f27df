Parliament’s portfolio committee on Home Affairs says it will make a decision on whether there is a need for a full inquiry into the Gupta family’s citizenship later in the year. In a statement, the committee says while the decision was expected to be made on Wednesday, 30 May it has since been informed that parliament’s legal representatives require more time to gather further information on the matter. “In principle‚ the decision to hold a full inquiry still holds. What the committee is awaiting is comprehensive information on the matter. The information required is with the Department of Home Affairs and dates back to the initial application in 1995. The report will also include a recommendation on the format that the inquiry must take. We will receive this report during the next session of Parliament‚ which is scheduled for August 2018.” said Committee chair, Hlomani Chauke. The Gupta citizenship matter came to the fore following a contradiction on Ajay and Atul Gupta’s status during Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba’s press conference on whether Atul and Ajay had been given South African citizenship. Meanwhile, the committee says their information gathering will also include the verification of the corporate social responsibility initiatives that the family provided to support their application under exceptional circumstances. -AfroVoice Reporter
