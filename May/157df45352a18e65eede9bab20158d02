National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete said an outside service provider has been appointed to conduct a feasibility and impact study into the proposal to move Parliament from Cape Town to Pretoria. Mbete made the announcement during the presenting of the National Assembly budget vote on Tuesday. She said the service provider Pamoja PTY LTD which started doing the job this month has six months to conclude its socio-economic and impact study and the matter would be handed over to the sixth Parliament which will be elected after the 2019 elections. There had been increased calls for Parliament to move to Pretoria as continued stay in Cape Town is perceived to be too costly for government and cannot be sustained. Mbete also announced that Parliament has been given R2.4 Billion for the year 2018/2019 after requesting for R2.8 Billion from Treasury. “We thus have a shortfall of R476 million,” she said. Mbete also said she was hopeful that the incidents of disruption in the house would be a thing of the past. The fifth Parliament has been fraught with several disruptions, at times leading to members being removed by force violently. EFF MPs have on a number of occasions been at the receiving end of parliament protections services. “The house experienced unprecedented instances of disorder. It is our hope that this will stay in the past. Thankfully, the quality of debate and order in our proceedings has certainly been improved,” she said. -Afro Voice Reporter
