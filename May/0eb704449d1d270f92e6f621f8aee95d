Former Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard has been appointed as manager of Championship side Derby County, with the second-tier side announcing the 39-year-old had agreed to a three-year deal on Thursday. Lampard, who was capped 106 times by England between 1999 and 2014, won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups and one Champions League with Chelsea and will be taking his first steps into senior management. “I’ve always wanted to manage a club with a big tradition and history like Derby County, so this is a huge opportunity,” Lampard told the club’s website https://www.dcfc.co.uk/news/2018/05/frank-lampard-joins-the-rams-as-new-manager. “We want to build on the club’s top-six finish in the Championship last season, while at the same time bringing through some of the excellent youth and academy talent we have at Pride Park.” -Reuters
