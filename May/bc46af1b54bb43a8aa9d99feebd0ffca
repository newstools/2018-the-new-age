The African National Congress (ANC) has called on the Police Minister Bheki Cele to do more to fight political killings in KwaZulu-Natal. The call comes after two more leaders in the province were gunned down in the province on Saturday, bringing to three the number of politicians killed this week. Msawenkosi “Maqatha Qashana” Mchunu and Sbuyiselo Dlamini were killed on Friday at different areas in the province. Mchunu succumbed to his gunshot injuries in hospital after he was shot multiple times at his house in KwaPata in the Moses Mabhida Region allegedly by two unknown assailants who entered his home and fired multiple times at him without uttering a single word. Dlamini, who is a member of the IFP Youth Brigade and the party’s Ward Councillor in Ulundi, was allegedly shot in his car at an intersection. Last week another ANC member at Oshabeni Branch and a treasurer at Ray Nkonyeni municipality in the Lower South Coast region Sifiso Cele was killed at his house in front of his wife and children. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said the ANC sent its condolences to the families of the leaders who lost their lives at the hands of “criminal assassins”. He said Mchunu would be remembered as one of the party’s militant cadres since his youth in the then Natal Midlands. “From 1996 to1998, he was the chairperson of the ANCYL in the Natal Midlands, a position he served with distinction. “After completing his term, due to his leadership skills, he was re-elected into the ANCYL regional executive committee (REC) from 1998 to 2000, as well as an ANC REC member.
