MINISTER of Police Bheki Cele has condemned threatening messages sent on Facebook to the Legal Aid lawyer who is representing, Sbonelo Mkhize, who is charged with the murder of Chatsworth schoolgirl Sadia Sukhraj. Cele who visited the Sukhraj family and later addressed the community at the Chatsworth Youth Centre called for calm in the wake of a community backlash since Sadia’s fatal shooting during a botched hijacking. He also said that Mkhize and his deceased accused were career criminals. “The accused (Mkhize) should not have even be out on the streets. He’s out on parole for a string of crimes including murder, robbery and hijacking. We really need to look at how our justice system is working because such criminals should be locked up for life,” Cele said. The minister also confirmed that the identity of the third suspect who is on the run is now known to the police. “All we have to do now is pick him up. Once he is arrested I hope they get long sentences,” Cele said. The threats to Mveku were revealed during Mkhize’s court proceeding in the Durban Magistrate’s Court where the accused abandoned his bail application because he was fearful for his life if he is released. Magistrate Mohamed Motala said: “I have been made aware of these threatening messages being sent to Miss Mveku via social media and I want to say it is unacceptable. In as much at the general members of the public are angry, this should not jeopardise the proper conduct of this case.” sibongisenim@afrotone.co.za
