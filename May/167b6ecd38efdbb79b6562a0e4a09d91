GLEBELANDS Hostel residents in Umlazi have applauded the work of the police following a breakthrough in the murder case of William Mthembu and Thokozani Machi who were killed in 2015. Police on Monday arrested a 38-yearold man in Harding for the murder of the two men. Mthembu and Machi were ambushed and killed in September 2015 while at a supermarket in Montclair. Police spokesperson Lt Col Thulani Zwane said the investigation into the murder revealed they had been killed as a result of the tensions in the hostel. About that time more than 20 people had been killed in the fight for beds at the hostel. The man will appear in the Umlazi Magistrate’s Court today. He has also been linked to the attempted murder of Fezeka Njiyelo, 29, who was shot in 2016 at the hostel. “The suspect will also be charged with two counts of murder where two Glebelands Hostel residents were killed at Montclair in 2015. He is expected to join the seven other suspects whose bail was successfully opposed,” Zwane said. The seven suspects who will appear alongside the accused are convicted murderer Khayelihle Mbuthuma, 31, Durban Central detective Bhekukwazi Mdweshu, 37, Vukani Mcobothi, 25, Khayelihle Mbuthuma, 32, Wonderboy Hlophe, 37, Mpumulelo Mkhize‚ 28‚ Ncomekile Matlala Ntshangase and Mondli Mthethwa. Last week they were all denied bail in the Durban Magistrate’s Court. They were arrested in various stages throughout December 2017. Meanwhile, the arrest of the suspect has been applauded by acting provincial commissioner Maj-Gen Bheki Langa. sibongisenim@afrotone.co.za
