The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) on Wednesday is calling for ANC NEC member and Member of Parliament, Mduduzi Manana to resign from all his position following recent assault accusations which were later withdrawn by his domestic worker. “The ANCYL calls on Manana to follow his conscience and do the honourable thing, and resign from his positions in the ANC and parliament. His unrepentant actions are harming the image and public standing of the ANC, as a trusted leader and chief representative of popular aspirations of our people,” ” Furthermore, his continued participation in the ANC raises a false narrative in the public eye that the ANC protects or shields those accused (or found) to be at the wrong arm of the law,” reads the ANCYL statement. The Youth league says that Manana`s actions were a further reflection of the violent nature of the society “as evidenced by many violent deeds continuously reported and perpetrated by men against women,” The matter has been marred with controversy after allegations that the domestic worker had allegedly withdrawn the charges after Manana offered her R100 000. Following the news that the domestic worker had withdrawn the charges against Manana, an audio clip alleged to be of him offering R100 000 the domestic worker for her to drop the charges has surfaced. In the audio clip released by Times Live he can be heard saying that he was willing to do anything to make the matter go away. However, in his statement, Manana said that he was intending to lay charges of extortion alleging that the domestic workers family was demanding the money from him. “I am aware that a case of assault has been withdrawn but I have instructed my lawyers to file a legal suit against the Wiro family for extortion as they demanded an amount of R100 000,” he said. Meanwhile, the Youth League has also called on the ANC to take action against the former Minister “and subject Manana before a disciplinary hearing so that an appropriate sanction can be imposed on him, even if it means, his membership of the ANC has to be terminated,” Last year, Manana was also involved in another woman assault case where he was handed an R100 000 fine sentence and also ordered to undergo an anger management for assaulting a woman at Cubana nightclub. -Afro Reporter
