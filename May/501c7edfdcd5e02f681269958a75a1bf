Police are investigating whether an abandoned red Audi that was discovered near the Oriental Plaza in Fordsburg on Saturday could be linked to the recent cash-in-transit heists. The police discovered the abandoned vehicle with false number plates, an AK 47, R5 and ammunition. Five suspects were arrested on Thursday in connection with a cash-in-transit heist that happened in Boksburg. Meanwhile, on another incident on Friday, robbers bombed a G4S van on the N4 in Pretoria and left with an undisclosed amount of money. Speaking to Afro Worldview on Sunday, JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said that a tip-off from South African Police Service (SAPS) Crime Intelligence led to the discovery of the vehicle. “Officers saw gloves inside the car. When they opened up the boot they found an AK 47, and a Revolver. So there will be an investigation,” he said. Minnaar said that they were also investigating if the suspects were occupants on the flats where the car was discovered. Meanwhile, the police have also established that the car was also hijacked in Pretoria last month. The car has also been linked to other crimes. -Afro Reporter
