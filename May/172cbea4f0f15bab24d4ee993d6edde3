The Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (POPCRU) will be embarking on a national march to the Union building in Pretoria on Friday. According to the union,Â the decision follows its 2018 National Executive Committee (NEC) resolution to confront head-on all the challenges that have been raised but ignored for a long time. The union said that these challenges have adversely affected its members within the scope of operations. Among the issues to be contained in the detailed memorandums include: POPCRU will hand the memorandums over to the Ministers of Police, Justice, Transport and Health. As part of mobilising for the national march, the union will hold general meetings and lunch-time pickets across the country. -Afro Reporter
