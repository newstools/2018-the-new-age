Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has on Thursday announced new State Owned Board members and its chairpersons. Gordhan’s announcement follows the Cabinet meeting which was held in Cape Town on May 23rd, 2018. “The boards of state-owned enterprises have always been in the news. The President wants SOEs to be governed well, we are looking at a review of the operating models,” he said. Gordhan further said cabinet made a number of decisions in the relation of boards, like the appointment of Eskom new CEO Phakamani Hadebe. He said that Hadebe has been doing a good job adding that there is no reason why he should not formally take up the position. Among other appointees, Gordhan confirmed former Prasa Chairperson Popo Molefe as the new Transnet Chair. He said Molefe’s appointment as chair marked 86th day in office today (Wednesday) and that he is working with lightning speed to get state-owned enterprises on the right track. During his tenure as Prasa chairman Molefe had accused then Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba of withholding a Treasury nominee to his board and stifling corporate governance at the state enterprise. At the time, he claimed that there were attempts to isolate him. “They called non-executive directors one by one so that I remain alone because when I am alone, there will be on board to take decisions,” Molefe said at the time. -Afro Voice Reporter
