THERE’S more pain ahead for embattled state-owned airline SAA as the Treasury once again distances itself from further bail-outs. This is not good news for the heavyweight board announced in October tasked with returning the airline to stability. The team is led by CEO Vuyani Jarana, chairperson Johannes Magwaza and his deputy Nolitha Fakude. Last month, Jarana came under fire from a parliamentary standing committee when he said a further R4.8bn was needed immediately after December’s R10bn bail-out. MPs probed the board on the group’s going concern status which was flagged by the auditor-general in a report on the airline in March. The AG said the history of losses, lack of capital and volatility in foreign exchange rates, along with maturing loans and working capital deficiencies, indicated that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Briefing Parliament yesterday, Treasury director-general Dondo Mogajane said SAA required a R5bn cash injection in the current financial year to help it meet its financial obligations. “However, this will not come from the government, which to date has pumped a whopping R20bn into the company.” Mogajane said the Treasury was willing to consider selling a stake in the airliner to a private equity partner. bernards@afrotone
