MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane will use the upcoming match against Spanish giants Barcelona to pit his football know-how against the tactics of European coaches. Fresh from being crowned the PSL champions on Saturday, Sundowns will host the La Liga champions at FNB stadium on Wednesday as part of the Nelson Mandela centenary celebrations. “The Barca game is for the guys to get experience, to see how far, what’s the level and what is the difference between us and them, PSL and La Liga,” Mosimane said. “But for me personally, it is just to see how far our tactics are in relation to Barca of course we are not going to stop them from playing not body has done that. “They score two goals against Real Madrid last time, they scored five last week in their match against Villarreal and week before against Valencia they scored two. “They score a goal every 30 or 40 minutes then you can’t have stress. We are happy to play and lets see how long it will last before the first goal can come.” Mosimane said he will also use this match to see how his side responds against one of the best teams in the world in terms of how they defend and how they attack. “It is not about beating Barca or trying to match them. It is just to see our organisation the way we defend and the way we attack because we play our own way. “We have our own way of playing that we have mastered and we don’t play for hope. When we sign players, we sign those who will fit in the structure even though sometimes it doesn’t happen the way we want. “So Barca is for us to see the level, the difference, just to have fun and enjoy and see if we play the Sundowns way, can they stop us in those principles of attack. “It is all about that, it is not about who will win, we all know who will win. I think we expect Barca to win let’s be honest without saying we don’t have confidence. If we win, it is unbelievable.” -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@afrotone.co.za
