PAMELLA Mabini, the woman who is one of the key witnesses in the case against a Nigerian pastor charged with human trafficking and the rape of young girls, was threatened and shot at in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday night. Police spokesperson Capt André Beetge said a case of attempted murder had been opened and investigations were underway. “At 7.45pm a woman was attacked at her home in Kwazakhele by a masked gunman who jumped over a fence to gain entry. The gunman then fired two shots at her and fortunately, she got away unharmed,” Beetge said. Mabini said threats against her had been made in the past particularly by Omotoso’s supporters and congregation members who were present at the Port Elizabeth Magistrate’s Court when he appeared on Tuesday. “They sang ‘Phamela you are scared and the time is here’,” Mabini said. She said she knows it was the people who were supporting the pastor because the man who attacked her told her to leave the pastor alone. Omotoso and his co-accused’s case was transferred to the Port Elizabeth High Court for a pre-trial conference. The 58-year-old televangelist allegedly trafficked more than 30 girls and women who were from various branches of his church to a house in Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal, where he allegedly sexually exploited them. The Nigerian pastor was arrested in April last year at the Port Elizabeth Airport by the Hawks. He has tried numerous time to get bail but the state has maintained that he is a flight risk as he allegedly possesses a number of passports with different names. -SISANDA MADWANTSI
