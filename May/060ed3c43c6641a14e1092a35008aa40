ANC has welcomed the decision by President Cyril Ramaphosa that he would be donating half of his presidential salary to charity. The party said the philanthropic and selfless gesture undertaken by the president to the Nelson Mandela Foundation was a clear and tangible indication of the seriousness with which the party views its commitment to the recently launched Thuma Mina Campaign. The Nelson Mandela Thuma Mina Fund will be launched on, July 18, to mark the 100th anniversary of Mandela birth. Ramaphosa announced on Wednesday during the Presidency’s budget vote that he would pledge half of his presidential salary to the foundation which will be administering the Thuma Mina Fund. “This will go a long way in decreasing the burden of poverty, experienced by the downtrodden and offers some respite on inequalities brought about by unemployment,” ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said. Mabe also called on the party leaders to ensure that the Thuma Mina Campaign follows the example led by President Ramaphosa. -Afro Voice Reporter
