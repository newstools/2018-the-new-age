THE ANC is hard at work to douse the stubborn fire arising from events that led up to the ruling party’s December elective conference in Nasrec last year. This after ANC general manager Febe Potgieter-Gqubule said yesterday that the party had received a memorandum from disgruntled ANC Eastern Cape members from the Amathole, Nelson Mandela Bay and Joe Xabi regions, demanding that the provincial executive committee, led by provincial chairperson Oscar Mabuyane, be dissolved. Potgieter-Gqubule said the petition would be handed to the ANC’s national officials for further investigation. “We received a petition from members of the ANC. It will go to the officials. This is part of a process from our last national executive committee (NEC) meeting where we have been meeting with the provincial executive committee (PEC),” she said. Potgieter-Gqubule also said the ANC officials were still dealing with similar grievances on the running of ANC affairs in the Free State. “Wherever members of the ANC have grievances, we will meet with them. “Processes in the Free State of enlarging the interim committee so that it’s more representative are still being attended to,” she said. The group of aggrieved party members also demanded that the Sbu Ndebele report, which recommended that the ANC’s Eastern Cape provincial executive committee be disbanded, be implemented. ANC regional leader Ndoda Mesani yesterday called for the ANC’s top six to immediately disband the PEC in connection to irregularities of the party’s violent provincial conference last year. “The system of electing them was unconstitutional. They are not a legitimate structure. They are also purging our comrades, removing them from their positions in government. “We are demanding that the Sbu Ndebele report be implemented. The report said that the PEC must be disbanded,” Mesani said. bonolos@afrotone.co.za -BONOLO SELEBANO
