An audio clip alleged to be of former deputy minister of Higher Education Mduduzi Manana offering R100 000 to his domestic worker who brought charges of assault against him for her to drop the charges has surfaced. In the audio clip released by Times Live, he can be heard saying that he was willing to do anything to make the matter go away. Manana can be heard in the clip saying: “I’m willing to do anything…I am saying, just for any consolation, just to take care of umama for what she feels is humiliation, I can give a consolation to her. I can give her consolation to take care of her health….at least a hundred,” However, Manana previously issued a statement on Sunday claiming that the family was the one demanding the money from him. “I am aware that a case of assault has been withdrawn but I have instructed my lawyers to file a legal suit against the Wiro family for extortion as they demanded an amount of R100 000. Instead, I gave Ms. Wiro money that was due to her for the two weeks period that she worked at my home. Further details on this specific matter remain sub judice,” said Manana. Manana’s domestic worker had laid a common assault case against him which she later withdrew. The woman accused Manana of pushing her down the stairs of his home and also threatened to deport her to back to Zimbabwe. On Tuesday trade federation Cosatu said that it was deeply disturbed by the allegations against Manana. -Afro Reporter
