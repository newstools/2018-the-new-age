A 59-year-old provincial education department assistant director found guilty of demanding a bribe before approving a bursary for a student who wanted to study at the university last
year was sentenced to four years imprisonment by the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court last week. Mbhazima David Mabasa who demanded R4 400 from a student before approving a bursary worth about R90 000 to study at the University of Venda in Thohoyandou was sentenced to four years imprisonment with an option of paying R160 000 fine, half of which was suspended for five years on Thursday last week, Hawks provincial spokesperson Capt Matimba Maluleke said. Mabasa, who worked at the provincial education department headquarters in Polokwane, was arrested by the Hawks Serious Crime unit in May last year after a tip-off that he was to receive R4 400 from a woman to approve a bursary for her child. “The woman gave the risk and security unit of the department information which was passed on to the Hawks. Our officers immediately set up a trap and managed to apprehend him as he was about to receive the money. “He was subsequently hauled into the magistrate’s court and released on R1000 bail. “Thereafter he made subsequent court appearances which culminated in the conviction and sentence,” Maluleke said. Meanwhile, Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha has encouraged members of the public and civil servants to report any form of corruption to the police or the Anti-Corruption Forum.
“Goals of the National Development Plan (NDP) could not be achieved in an environment of rampant corruption. The NDP goals we have set for the province through the Limpopo Development Plan require that we liquidate corruption in all its forms. “Corruption undermines democratic institutions, slows economic development and contributes to government instability,” Mathabatha said. -MONTSHO MATLALA
