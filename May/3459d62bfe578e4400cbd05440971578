Legal Eagle Advocate Godfrey Lebeya has been appointed as the new head of Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI), popularly known as the Hawks. Communication Minister Nomvula Mokonyane made the announcement during a post-cabinet media briefing. Mokonyane said Lebeya’s appointment was confirmed by the cabinet. Lebeya takes over from Lieutenant General Yolisa Matakata, who has been acting in the position since the sacking of former head Berning Ntlemeza. Despite being in possession of a PhD in law, Lebeya has had a 30-year career in the police service where he held numerous posts as deputy national police commissioner and as former head of detective services. He was also one of two high-ranking officers who was awarded a multimillion-rand settlement after being fired illegally by former commissioner Riah Phiyega, one being another deputy police commissioner Leah Mofomme. -Afro Voice Reporter
