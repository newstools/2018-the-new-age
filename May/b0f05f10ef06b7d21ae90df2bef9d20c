ANC Treasurer-General Paul Mashatile will deliver a eulogy at the funeral of the late party stalwart and former SABC Board Chairperson Eddie Funde. Funde died on Tuesday last week due to cardiac arrest. The funeral service will be held at the Bryanston Methodist Church on Grosvenor Road in Bryanston Johannesburg on Thursday. He will later be put to rest at his final resting place at the Fourways Memorial Park Cemetery. Several ANC, government and ordinary members of the public paid their tributes to Funde at the memorial service organised by the Department of Internation Relations and Cooperation(DIRCO) on Monday. Funde chaired the SABC board between 2004 and 2008 and upon leaving the public broadcaster, was appointed as South Africa’s ambassador to Germany. He also served as an ANC representative in Australasia and Pacific from 1983 to 1989. -AfroVoice Reporter
