Free State MEC of Police, Roads and Transport Sam Mashinini has been elected as the ANC Provincial Chairperson during the party’s eighth provincial conference. Mashinini replaces Ace Magashule, who was elected Secretary-General at the party’s elective conference in December. Former Provincial Secretary and Provincial Task Team (PTT) Coordinator William Bulwane was elected as Mashinini’s deputy, while another PTT Convenor Paseka Nompondo was chosen as a provincial Secretary and Legislature Speaker Mamiki Qabathe as his deputy. Recently appointed Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela is now the party’s provincial Treasurer. ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) member Nomvula Mokonyane, who was representing the NEC at the conference lashed out at those who were quick to criticise the party’s processes when they lose positions during elections. Mokonyane called on the ANC leaders to stop with their petty squabbles and deliver services to South Africans. She warned those who are taking the party to court as a result of their unhappiness. This is after Lehlohonolo Chris Jan, Nomveliso Mapisa and Matshepo Ramakatsa wrote to the PTT threatening to apply for an interdict if the conference went on on Saturday. “You stay, you work and influence others and one day your views will be understood,” Mokonyane said. The three said their attempts to speak to the PTT to inform it that it was reconvening the conference with delegates who participated in a nullified process. The elective congress is expected to wrap up today. -Afro Reporter
