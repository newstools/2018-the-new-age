THE possibility of history being a compulsory subject from Grade 10 may be edging closer as the Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga will release the ministerial task team report on the subject’s introduction in schools tomorrow. As part of Africa Month, the department has been on a drive for a curriculum overhaul from a Eurocentric model to a more Afrocentric system that will be phased in over the years. The new curriculum is expected to be phased in over seven years starting from next year. The report by the task team was initially meant to be released on May 25 to coincide with Africa Day. The task team conducted research on India, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, China, Tanzania, Russia and Brazil “to add to the international research”. “In 2015 the department hosted the inaugural History Roundtable where the ministerial task team led by Prof Sibusiso Ndlovu was established and given terms of reference to conduct a comparative international study on how best to implement the introduction of history as a compulsory subject in FET schools,” department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said. “The team was also responsible for the review and strengthening of the content of history in the FET and the General Education and Training bands,” he said. The South African Democratic Teachers Union first called for history to be made compulsory in 2014. -LILLIAN SELAPISA|lillians@afrotone.co.za
