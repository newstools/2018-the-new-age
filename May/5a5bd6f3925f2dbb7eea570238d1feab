The African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng has described plans by the Democratic Alliance (DA) to table a motion of no confidence against premier David Makhura as ridiculous, frivolous and desperate. The DA announced that it would on 15 May table a motion of no confidence against Makhura as a result of 144 mental patients who died at Life Esidimeni facilities. DA Gauteng leader John Moody said it was under Makhura’s watch that the patients lost their lives, hence the decision to table a motion against him. Speaking on the SABC’s Morning Live, Gauteng ANC provincial Secretary Hope Papo said Health Ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba and the Life Esidimeni Arbitration hearings had not found Makhura guilty of anything. “Their motion has nothing to do with Life Esidimeni. This motion flies in the face of Professor Makgoba and Justice Moseneke’s reports,” “There is no factual basis for this motion and we reject it with the contempt it deserves,” Papo said. He added that they were confident the motion will be defeated by ANC members in the legislature and were also calling on other parties not to support the motion. “We urge all other parties in the legislature not to be hoodwinked by the DA into supporting this frivolous motion,” Papo said the premier has implemented almost all recommendations made by professor Makgoba as Health Ombudsman. -Afro Reporter
