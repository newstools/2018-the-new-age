IT WAS better that some of the information given to him in connection with the attack on three people at a Verulam mosque were rather given to investigators in the Hawks, Police Minister Bheki Cele said. “Everybody agrees it’s a new phenomenon in South Africa,” he said. Cele told a media briefing last night that he had spoken to the families of some of the people injured in the knife attack at the mosque last week. “There are things that they said which are better should be given to the investigators,” Cele said. “It looks like more and more people say we would not be making a mistake by investigating cases of extremism.” He said he did want to elaborate more because it would be speculation. On the political violence in KZN, he said he and the other ministers who formed the state security cluster would go to the province on Monday. “We want to get a thorough briefing of what has happened.” Almost 20 people, mostly from the ANC have been killed recently. “All of them are shot. They don’t shoot themselves. Where are the people who shoot those people? We’ll sit down and listen and see, but the president said ‘go there and sort that thing out’. We have to sort it out.” -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
