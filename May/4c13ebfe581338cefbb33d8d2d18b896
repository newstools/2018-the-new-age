Former Western Cape police chief Arno Lamoer and his three co-accused have been slapped with jail sentences by the Western Cape high court after being found guilty of corruption. Lamour, tow truck business owner Salim Dawjee, Brigadiers Darrius Van Der Ross and Colin Govender, all pleaded guilty to charges of corruption early this year. Lamoer and Dawjee were both sentenced to eight years behind bars, with Lamoer’s two years suspended after he admitted to accepting “loans” from Dawjee‚ and also admitting to “wrongfully” and “unlawfully” issuing a letter of good standing for Dowjee on SAPS letterheads, and also having him pay for his clothes and holidays. Dawjee’s businesses were also collectively fined R60 000, R40 000 of which was suspended. Govender was sentenced to six years imprisonment, two of which were suspended for receiving “unauthorised” gratifications totalling R1.2-million”, while Van der Ross was jailed for four years‚ with two years suspended after also receiving “gratifications” which included having his car being filled with petrol in exchange for favours. The four were acquited on charges of racketeering and money laundering earlier this year after initially being charged with more than 100 charges of corruption, racketeering and money laundering. Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police Francois Beukman has welcomed the jail sentence given to the four. Beukman said the sentence will send a clear message that the rule of law must be adhered to at all times. “We are of the view that the sentence will serve as a deterrent to any police officer not to engage in acts of corruption,” “Furthermore, the sentence will serve to reassure the public that no one is above the law”Beukman said. Beukman said the committee has for the longest time been calling for a clean up of Saps of any rogue elements and to restore confidence in the Saps’ ability to provide safety and security to the people of South Africa -Afro Reporter
