A SECOND incident featuring the bodyguards of high-ranking KZN politicians has surfaced. While there are claims that the men who are seen in a video firing pistols and rifles in deserted open veld, are from the province’s south coast, the ANC officials in the area have denied knowing them. In the 30-second video, the men can be seen randomly firing in the air, one of them with an AK 47 while a group behind them watches before joining in.

The killings have been partly blamed on the private security industry for hiring people with criminal records. A reliable source identified one of the men as a political bodyguard who is a member of the security detail of a South Coast ANC mayor. “One of the men there is a guard of a female South Coast mayor. I know him because I once worked with him in northern KZN before his company collapsed and he moved to the South Coast,” the source said. The last video of security personnel publicly discharging their firearms in Hillcrest saw Nkosingiphile Gase, 36, Thembinkosi Gcabashe, 39, and Sno Mlamuli Khoza, 38, sentenced to one years imprisonment suspended for a period of five years. Meanwhile, two of the three suspects arrested for the killing of Sifiso Cele, an ANC member in the south coast, have been granted bail. The third suspect is still behind bars after saying he wants to be a state witness. -SIHLE MAVUSO|sihlem@afrotone.co.za
