Democratic Alliance(DA) has asked the Registrar of Banks to investigate VBS Mutual Bank and the municipalities that illegally deposited money into it despite warnings not to do so. He said as the DA, they were urging the register of banks to establish a similar commission to the one that was set up when credit lender African Bank was placed under curatorship. “The terms of reference for this commission should follow similar processes taken by the Registrar in the African Bank instance,” Mileham said. He said the dire state of affairs at the institution necessitates an urgent and thorough investigation to ascertain the full extent of the problems at the institution given the increasing number of allegations and the potential loss of billions of rands of municipal deposits. -Afro Reporter
