The South African Rugby Union says that it is ‘surprised and concerned’ following SuperSport rugby analyst Ashwin Willemse’s walkout during the live broadcast of Saturday’s Vodacom Super Rugby matches. Willemse walked out of the live Super Rugby show after allegations that he felt “undermined” and “patronised” by his fellow analysts Nick Mallett and Naas Botha. “We were as surprised and concerned as the rest of the rugby community by Saturday evening’s incident on SuperSport. It would not be fair to make snap judgements. However, something was clearly amiss and it reflected poorly on rugby. This is a SuperSport matter and we have asked to be kept informed on the process of the investigation,” Reads an SA Rugby statement. Willemse walked out while he and the other analysts were reviewing a match between the Golden Lions and ACT Brumbies. The former South Africa winger is reported to have said that “he cannot work with people who undermine other people” while asked to give his comments about the match. SuperSport has since announced that an investigation on the matter will be conducted. It remains unclear at the moment what caused Willemse to walked out of the studio. Meanwhile, Black First Land First (BLF) leader, Andile Mngxitama, says that the rugby analyst should not lose his job due to the incident. I hope the blacks on Twitter wouldn't allown @DStv to punish the victim of racism and reward  those two boere racists. Ashwin must not lose his job. #AshwinWillemse — andile (@Mngxitama) May 20, 2018   What Ashwin Willemse addressed is something many people of colour experience. It’s a subtle undermining and condescending approach that is difficult to prove, but you know it when you experience it. Then you’re accused of ‘having a chip on your shoulder.’ pic.twitter.com/bMS3KcVeZG — Khaya Dlanga (@khayadlanga) May 20, 2018  -Afro Reporter
