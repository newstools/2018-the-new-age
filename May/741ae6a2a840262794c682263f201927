Thirty-one percent of the country’s municipalities are completely dysfunctional; according to Corporative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) Minister Zweli Mkhize. Mkhize revealed the startling news on Tuesday during his department’s budget vote in Cape Town. He said 12 municipalities out of 18 in the North West province were currently being managed by COGTA, adding that they were all under administration. “87 priority municipalities are distressed or dysfunctional and are receiving national support under Section 139. Several municipalities owe Eskom R23.6 Billion for services and Water Board. ” Municipalities in the Free State and Limpopo are worst offenders causing a massive blow to big business,” the minister said. Mkhize told parliamentarians that an aggressive turnaround strategy is needed to reverse the culture of impunity and inaction in poor functioning municipalities. The minister’s intervention comes after his commitment that the Municipal Infrastructure Support Agent (MISA), will intervene extensively and urgently in dysfunctional municipalities and those in distress, in relation to the development and maintenance of infrastructure. “Government’s infrastructure delivery system has been successful at creating new infrastructure over the past 20 years. ” However, despite several technical capacity building initiatives implemented over the years, there are still many municipalities that are struggling to use funds allocated to them to build or maintain infrastructure,” the minister said at the time. -Afro Worldview Reporter
