Celebrity power couple Basetsana and Romeo Kumalo have denied rumours that have been reported in the past week alleging the involvement of Romeo on a sex tape with a male hip-hop artist. This comes after claims on social media that there was a video which is doing the rounds in which the businessman allegedly performs sexual acts with another known male artist. “We issue this statement in response to those false and defamatory allegations. The allegations allude to a sex tape which does not exist. The source of the allegations is an author whom we have never met, spoken to or had any dealings with. We can only deduce for reasons which remain unclear, that the motivation behind these unfounded and salacious rumours was nothing but pure malice, and perhaps an attempt by the author to create publicity and boost her book sales.” Reads the statement from Basetsane. The author mentioned by the Khumalo alleges to have seen the sex tape and claims that it has been the “source of Basetsane’s ‘drinking”. Meanwhile, the Kumalo’s say they have since laid charges of crimen injuria and are in the process of applying for Protection Orders against those responsible. “We have sought legal counsel and have laid criminal charges of crimen injuria and are applying for Protection Orders against those responsible. The defamatory content has also since been picked up by mainstream media, and we are considering other legal options available, including laying a complaint to the Independent Media Ombudsman,”The Khumalo’s statement added. It is also alleged that the said ‘video’ was taken by a ‘friend’ who allegedly blackmailed Romeo and made it available to social media. -Afro Voice Reporter
