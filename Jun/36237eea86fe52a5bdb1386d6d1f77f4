KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu will today receive the final report of the investigation into the spate of politicallyÂ motivated killings in the province. The commission which was chaired by renowned lawyer Advocate Marumo Moerane wrapped its proceedings in March after it started with its work in 2016 following the appointment by Mchunu. The commission looked into the killings of high profile political leaders in the province from 2011 without anyone facing trial for the killings. Amongst those who testified at the commission include Thabiso Zulu, a friend of former ANC Youth League Secretary-General Sindiso Magada, former KwaZulu-Natal Premier Senzo Mchunu, and former kwaDukuza mayor Siyanda Mhlongo. Zulu told the commission about the extent of the rot and corruption at municipalities falling under the Harry Gwala District Municipality. He also said Magaqa, was shot because he discovered corruption within uMzimkhulu Municipality, which falls under Harry Gwala. Mnchunu testified that state resources were being used to target individuals and that intelligence apparatus were doing very little to thwart this, while Mhlongo attributed the spate of killings to mainly unqualified public officials who were scrambling for government jobs. There has been a request for the transcripts not to be made public after safety concerns were raised about doing so. -Afro Voice Reporter
