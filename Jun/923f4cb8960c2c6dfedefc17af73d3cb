The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Limpopo intends to report MEC for Health in the province Dr Phophi Ramathuba to the provincial Legislature’s Ethics Committee for alleging saying Aids was a “black people’s” disease. The DA says the MEC’s utterances were not only reckless and inflammatory but also amounted to hate speech and discrimination. According to reports, while speaking during a meeting between her department and the Moutse Health Crisis Committee in April, the MEC allegedly said “Aids is a black people disease’. On Monday, she clarified her utterances and said she was quoted out of context by the news report. “I have quoted what SANAC [South African National AIDS Council] Society in their press statement have said that Aids is prevalent amongst black communities. However, money that is supposed to treat HIV and Aids it is in the hands of the whites and that is true.”Ramathuma told commercial radio station Power FM on Monday. DA Spokesperson on Health in the Province Langa Bodlani said Ramathuma’s utterances reminded him of former President Thabo Mbeki’s denial about HIV/Aids, and the provision of anti-retroviral(ARV) drugs which led to the country losing 300 000 lives to the disease. “It is clear that MEC Ramathuba has opted to undermine all patients affected and living with HIV and AIDS, instead of actively working with all stakeholders in order to find solutions,” Bodlani said. He said the DA called on the Ethics committee to immediately summon the MEC to account and publicly apologise and withdraw her alleged remarks. -Afro Voice Reporter
