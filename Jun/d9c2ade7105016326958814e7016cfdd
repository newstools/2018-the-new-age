Former President Jacob Zuma’s case has been postponed for a second time until 27 July in order to allow the defence team to settle a number of outstanding matters. During a brief sitting of the Durban High Court, state prosecutor Billy Downer said that while they are ready to begin with the trial in November, the defense has yet to submit its review application. According to Zuma’s defense lawyer, Michael Hulley, they are still uncertain whether the state will foot the former presidents legal bill pending the outcome of a challenge by the DA. @ANCKZN PTT Coordinator Sihle Zikalala greats Zuma as he arrives at the Durban High Court #ZumaCharges @AfroVoiceLIVE @afroworldview pic.twitter.com/9u2SEyQY3y — Phathisa Mfuyo (@thisamfuyo) June 8, 2018 Judge Mjabuliseni Madondo confirmed that the matter will now be moved to the Pietermaritzburg High Court Last Zuma supporters held a vigil at Albert Park ahead of his appearance.
