THE South African Local Government Association (Salga) said it was sticking to its offer because it cannot afford the South African Municipal Workers Union’s (Samwu’s) wage increase demands. Salga spokesperson Sivuyile Mbambato said the association was hopeful the upcoming wage negotiations set to take place on Thursday and Friday would produce a breakthrough. The union has previously rejected Salga’s 7% wage offer. The union said it demanded an 8-10% wage increase from the employer. “We will hear from Samwu because they are the ones that said they were going to go back to their members to seek clarity. “We will need to listen to them and they will need to give us feedback on what they have done and start negotiating from there,” Mbambato said. Samwu media officer Papiki Mohale said they would receive feedback from their members on the offer after the negotiations concluded on Friday. Recently Samwu general secretary Simon Mathe said municipalities were able to afford the pay hike. “We are finding ourselves in a situation where everything has increased. We are looking at an increase of tax. With the current offer from Salga, our members cannot earn a decent livelihood. “The other issue is that in municipalities there is an amount of R60bn which has been reported as irregular expenditure so therefore it means that municipalities can afford the increase if they manage finances properly,” he said. Mathe said they would not lower their demands while Salga has maintained it cannot afford the increment. Mathe also said the salary gap between the ordinary workers and the senior managers was huge and the gap needed to be closed. He said they had brought down their initial demands from 15% to 8-10% and were not going to accept anything below that. tiisetsom@afrotone.co.za -TIISETSO MANOKO
