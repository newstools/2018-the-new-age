On Wednesday, Eskom CEO Phakamani Hadebe reiterated the company’s position, saying the company was in no position to offer increases. Hadebe said Eskom had adopted several austerity measures which will ensure that the company is back to financial profitability. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe took to Twitter to show a banner which was handed to workers at some of its sites, warning them against going to work. #PowerUpdate: Intimidation and road blockades are rife at most of Eskom’s power stations and regional offices this morning, a move that might compromise Eskom’s ability to keep the lights on. Eskom will continue to provide regular updates on various media platforms. pic.twitter.com/4mEdhM3ls9 — Khulu Phasiwe (@KhuluPhasiwe) June 14, 2018 Phasiwe said this may impact on the power utility’s ability to keep lights on. -Afro Voice Reporter
