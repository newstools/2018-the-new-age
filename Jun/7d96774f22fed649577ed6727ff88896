A TWO-MONTH-OLD baby who was stolen from her home at the weekend was found and reunited with her mother hours after the terrifying ordeal, thanks to a swift reaction by the police. The baby, Anoyolo Maqashu, was snatched from her home in Gugulethu by a woman who is known to the mother on Sunday morning. Police said the mother of the child left her two children, the baby and eightyear-old daughter at her home at Kiki Hostels with the suspect while she went shopping. When she returned from town she was informed that the baby had disappeared with the woman she had left her with. Her eight-year-old daughter did not know their whereabouts. The matter was then reported to the police who immediately launched an intensive search for both the suspect and the baby. Police visited the suspect’s boyfriend who informed them that she (the suspect) had come to the house, collected all her clothing and left. A quick response by the police and following up all possible leads put them on the trail of the kidnapper and led investigators to Atlantis. The suspect was traced and arrested on Sunday evening in Atlantis. The baby was then reunited unharmed with the mother. Police spokesperson Sgt Noloyiso Rwexana said: “A 32-year-old woman who kidnapped a two-month-old baby was arrested on Sunday night in Atlantis. Once she has been charged she will appear in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court. The baby was found and reunited with her mother unharmed. Investigations are continuing.” Police thanked members of the community who helped in tracing and finding the baby hours after the kidnapping. -VINCENT CRUYWAGEN|vincentc@afrotone.co.za
