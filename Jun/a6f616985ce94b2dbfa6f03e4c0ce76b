Former President Jacob Zuma has on Wednesday said he would like to see education made compulsory in the country since the government made tertiary education free. Zuma was speaking at the Congress of South African Students (Cosas) Youth launch in KwaZulu-Natal. “Don’t think school is a torture. School is a necessity for you to study that is why it must be compulsory. Now if I had an agreement with the parliamentarians, I would have said to parliamentarians, now that we have free education, we must now have compulsory education. “A child who would be found loitering during school must be taken to task. Must explain why because you are delaying the black nation by not studying. You end up being influenced by the ones who do not want school,” said Zuma. He said education should be used to liberated black communities. “Education was used to further suppressed and subjugate us. Education must again be used by us to empower ourselves and to liberate ourselves fully. “We should have declared free education more than 10 years back. We would be very far now in terms of how we understand and what is it that we are doing at every level in our country. “We need it not just to broaden but to deepen our understanding of what we need to do in our country to make SA a prosperous country as we say in the Freedom Charter,” said Zuma. -Afro Voice Reporter
