Arsenal’s new manager Unai Emery has been handed a difficult start to the domestic season as they host reigning Premier League champions Manchester City on Aug. 11. Emery replaced Arsene Wenger as the north London club seek a fresh approach at the Emirates Stadium but the Spaniard’s credentials will be tested by City, who became the first team in English league to secure 100 points last term. It does not get any easier for Emery as Arsenal will then travel to London rivals Chelsea in their second clash. Liverpool, who will look to build on their Champions League final appearance, will open their campaign against West Ham United in what will be manager Manuel Pellegrini’s first competitive game in charge of the London side. Jose Mourinho’s Manchester United kick off their season at home against Leicester City, while Tottenham Hotspur will visit Newcastle United. Championship winners Wolverhampton Wanderers will mark their return to the top division against Marco Silva’s Everton at Molineux. -Reuters
