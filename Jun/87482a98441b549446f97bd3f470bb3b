Rolls-Royce, the British maker of plane engines, said Thursday that it plans to cut 4,600 mainly British jobs by 2020, adding to thousands of cuts already announced in recent years. “Rolls-Royce announces the next stage in our drive for pace and simplicity with a proposed restructuring that will deliver improved returns, higher margins and increased cash flow,” the group said in a statement. -AFP
