South Africa international Nizaam Carr has sealed a permanent move to English Premiership side Wasps after a successful spell there last term the club announced on Friday. The 27-year-old No8 — capped five times — scored four tries in 11 appearances for Wasps when he filled in for three months as injury cover last season. Carr has played for Super Rugby franchise The Stormers since he left Wasps in January — he is just four shy of a century of appearances for them since he made his debut in 2012 — and has also been a regular in Western Province’s Currie Cup line-up for the last seven years. “Nizaam made a massive impact during the time he was with us in the autumn,” Wasps director of rugby Dai Young told the club website. “As a powerful ball-carrier with plenty of pace he proved to be a really good fit with our playing style. “His close-quarter work also really stood out in a couple of games played in bad weather. “We are therefore really delighted that he is rejoining us on a permanent basis and look forward to seeing him become part of a very strong back-row group.” AFP
