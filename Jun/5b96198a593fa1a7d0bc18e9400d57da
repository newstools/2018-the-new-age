Sassa and South African Post Office (Sapo) have called on all beneficiaries who are still using old Sassa cards to go swap them for the new ones this weekend at dedicated venues around the country. The agency said that the old cards will be fully phased-out by the 30th of September this year. Sapo COO Londiwe Kwele said that Sassa and post office employees will be on duty in more than 70 card swap venues on Saturday and Sunday. “We advise Sassa beneficiaries to take advantage of these extended operating hours on weekends and swap their cards before the end of August to avoid the last minute rush.” She said that the new card will operate fully within the national payment systems and will have the following benefits: She further added that beneficiaries will not be charged R10 per month or any service fee when using the new card, ensuring that people get their grant in full. “The new card is yellowish to gold in colour and beneficiaries can still change to the new card even if they unknowingly accepted another card recently.” -Afro Voice Reporter
