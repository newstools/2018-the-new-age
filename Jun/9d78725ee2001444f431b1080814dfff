South Africa’s Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) has announced that two suspected rhino poaching kingpins have been arrested on suspicion of dealing with illegal rhino horn. The two suspected syndicates, Mandla Mashele and Calvin Malopane appeared in the Benoni Magistrate’s Court last month where they were each handed an R50 000 bail. Their case was postponed to July 13 for further investigation. The police said that the two suspects were given strict restrictions where they have to report daily to a local police station between 6 am and 7 pm. They also cannot leave their regions without informing the investigating officer. “They have to submit their passport and they are not allowed to apply for a new passport until their case is finalised,” Hawk’s Johan Jooste said. Police said that the syndicates are suspected to have supplied these rhino horns to the markets in South East Asia. Sanparks CEO Fundisile Nketine said as the national park they are happy with the arrest. -Afro Voice Reporter
