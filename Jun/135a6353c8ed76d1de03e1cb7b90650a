NEW Orlando Pirates midfielder Linda Mntambo is living his childhood dream of playing for his favourite team. Mntambo, who started his pre-season camp with the Buccaneers, said playing for the Soweto giants was always his dream. This is because he is staying not far from Orlando Stadium, Pirates’ home ground. He used to go there as a child to watch the team play and still remembers how he played his first official match at the venue with his former team Jomo Cosmos a few seasons back. Now having joined Pirates, he is relishing the prospect of making a name for himself with the club. “I had a good time with the orientation because I have always wanted to be a Buccaneer,” Mntambo said. “I live across the road from the stadium so I have always supported the team. I never missed a game at Orlando while I was growing up and I always dreamt of seeing myself playing here.” The 29 year old still remembers the beating he got while playing for Cosmos in 2016, before they were relegated that season. “The last time I played here was terrible though, we lost 5-0 to Pirates while I was still at Jomo Cosmos. “I remember being very sad as I walked home after the game but also felt a little bit of joy for playing on the pitch despite the result. “Now that I’m officially a Buccaneer, I’m over the moon and can’t wait for the season to start,” he said. Mntambo knows that competition will be tough at the Buccaneers but he is confident he will make it. He will be competing with Xola Mlambo, Mpho Makola, Musa Nyatama, Issa Sarr and Thamsanqa Sangweni in the middle of the park. “It’s a great opportunity being here and reuniting with my former teammates Phetso Maphanga and Diamond Thopola.” -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@afrotone.co.za
