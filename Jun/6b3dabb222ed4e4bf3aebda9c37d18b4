The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the North West has called on former Premier Supra Mahumapelo to put his money where his mouth is and pay back an R1 Million bursary awarded to his son by state arms manufacturer Denel. The DA said it also welcomes the decision to investigate those responsible for awarding the bursary and the allocation of a security tender to Mahumapelo’s brother Tau. Early this year, Mahumapelo promised to pay back the bursary money if it is proven that it was awarded to his son through dubious means, insisting that his son applied like any other person. On Sunday, Rapport newspaper revealed that newly appointed Denel Chairperson Monhla Hlala confirmed that the company’s previous bosses acted irregularly when awarding a bursary to Mahumapelo’s son. The newspaper further revealed that Hlahla also confirmed that the decision to award a  security contract to Mahumapelo’s brother was irregular. DA leader in the province Joe McGluwa said it was imperative to also hold former Denel CEO Zwelakhe Ntshepe, and board chairperson, Daniel Mantsha who both resigned, accountable for the apparent shady dealings that went down at Denel under their watch. “Furthermore, we strongly feel that education is one of the cornerstones of our society and should be used to empower the people of North West – especially the poor. “This bursary could have enriched the lives of honourable recipients,” McGluwa said. McGluwa said millions of people in the province were unemployed and that the Department of Education and schools is in dire need of fixing up in order to improve the conditions for both learners and teachers. “A million Rand bursary could create a future for at least 15 students who enrol full time for three years at one of our local universities,” said McGluwa. -Afro Voice Reporter
