Cash delivery drivers have on Tuesday staged a protest march over the increased number of cash-in-transit heist robberies. The workers are calling for government’s intervention to combat heists. Motor Transport Workers Union Secretary Mdumiseni Mabaso said that the employees will stage protests in Durban, Cape Town and Gauteng where they will hand over a memorandum of grievances to the Gauteng legislature. “Our concern is that the robberies have been going on, we have seen how the lack of police intelligence is playing its role, usually in the past they would easily pick up robberies when they are going to happen. Now it’s no longer happening,” he said. The protest follows a high number of the cash-in-transit heist that have been experienced across the country. Last month, the Gauteng Community Safety MEC, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane revealed that there have been 96 cash-in-transit cases in Gauteng only in the past nine months. This is for the period from August 2017 to May 2018. Mabaso said that the cash delivery drivers will deliver their memorandum to the Gauteng MEC for Community Safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane. The workers also want the industry to be regulated and for the cash vans to have their armouring standards upgraded. “We can’t leave the trucks that carry money openly to anybody as a normal business. We have got fly-by-night that is now taking this business and this is causing a serious problem,” Mabaso said. He added they also want the Cash Vans to be given access to drive on the emergency line because the drivers end up in a vulnerable situation when they get stuck in traffic.    -Afro Voice Reporter
