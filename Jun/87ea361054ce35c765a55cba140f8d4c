THE Basic Education Department has lambasted research and policy organisation SA Institute of Race Relations (SAIRR) for its call for parents to exercise greater influence and control over schools as “misinformed and suspicious”. Department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said parents already had a great amount of say in the way schools were run through school governing Bodies (SGBs). The SAIRR called on parents to become directly involved in the running of schools to improve the education system. “It is clear the authors of the report have an agenda and that they want to keep certain schools exclusive for certain racial groups,” Mhlanga said. SAIRR campaign manager Marius Roodt said greater choice for parents on which school to send their children to and greater control on how schools operate, would result in better outcomes. He said strengthening SGBs and giving them wider powers, rather than eroding them, as present policy initiatives intend to do, should go hand-in-hand with a new approach to funding, and the introduction of charter or contract schools. However, Mhlanga rejected Roodt’s suggestion: “We do not agree with the SAIRR because we deal with many challenges in schools around issues of governance where in some schools SGBs behave as though they are law unto themselves.” The SAIRR also said parents should be allowed to decide on school policies such as admission and language policies, something Mhlanga said was not necessary. The report proposed a voucher system which “would effectively be a universal bursary system”. “Some state schools could be sold to community groups, churches, nonprofit organisations and private education providers for a nominal amount (say R1), similar to the charter or contract school system used abroad. These schools would then be responsible for the payment of salaries and upkeep of the school,” Roodt said. -LILLIAN SELAPISA|lillians@afrotone.co.za
