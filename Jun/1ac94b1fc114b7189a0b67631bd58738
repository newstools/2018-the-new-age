TV AND radio personality Somizi Mhlongo has asked social media users to help him track down a University of Pretoria student who called him the K-word on Twitter yesterday. The woman, who goes by the name of Lia Meyer, wrote yesterday: “Isn’t @ Somizi like a homosexual Kaferketjie?” Mhlongo threatened to lay a case of crimen injuria against her. “My Tweeter investigators please help find the details of this racist. Jail awaits her,” Mhlongo wrote. Social media users and fans of the Idols SA judge called her out for being a racist and a contributor to the country’s racial divisions. However, Meyer claims she was hacked. “This is my account that was hacked,” she wrote. “I would never make such a remark. I take no responsibility for the view expressed in that tweet.” However, Mhlongo said he’s not letting this go. “We gonna teach them a lesson one person at a time.” Speaking to Afro Voice, South African Human Rights Commission’s Phillip Molekoa said: “Mhlongo can lodge a complaint with us, or someone who was offended may do it on his behalf or we could also pick it up and make further investigations to determine how she can be held accountable.” NONTOKOZO GXUMISA nontokozog@afrotone.co.za
