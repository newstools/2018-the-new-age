The Sibanye-Stillwater mine has confirmed that a fourth miner has passed away at the Kloof Ikamva shaft after three mineworkers were reported dead on Monday. The mineworkers succumbed to heat and gas exposure. “Sibanye-Stillwater regrets to update that mine rescue teams have located the deceased body of the fourth missing employee in an abandoned stope ore pass at its Kloof Ikamva shaft. “Specialised proto teams have been working through the night to locate and retrieve the employee but it is currently uncertain how long the retrieval process will take,” Sibanye-Stillwater said in a statement. On Monday five miners entered an abandoned working area where four of the five miners passed away after they were exposed to the gas and heat. The Mine says that the search for the fifth mine worker is underway while a thorough investigation will be undertaken into the incident that led to the death of three employees. Following the incident, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) called on the President Cyril Ramaphosa to intervene in amending mine safety legislation in order to curb the deaths at mines. “We call on President Ramaphosa to urgently intervene and address this issue. AMCU would like to see the Mine Health and Safety Act amended to give more power to workers and trade unions to address safety issues‚ in order to counter the power of mining companies and bosses,” AMCU said.    -Afro Voice Reporter
