The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Limpopo said it would write to the Ethics Committee to request it to charge Deputy Speaker Lehlogonolo Masoga for gross and unethical behaviour. The DA said it will also write to the legislator Speaker Polly Boshielo to implement the Public Protector’s decisions with immediate effect in order to ensure that the funds were recovered in full before the end Masoga’s term. The announcement comes two days after Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane found Masoga guilty of maladministration and improper conduct by failing to ensure that state resources were well spent. Mkhwebane ordered Masoga to pay back portions of more than  R125 000 cellphone bill which he ran up during a working trip to the USA in 2014 after it was settled by the provincial government. DA leader in the province James Smalle said the finding against Masoga should serve as a warning to politicians and officials who abuse state resources and it is the DA’s duty to “vigorously people’s money” in order to ensure that residents of the province receive better services. “The Public Protector’s report found that the Deputy Speaker did not act in an ethical manner and failed to ensure that state resources were effectively and prudently spent,” Smalle said. -Afro Voice Reporter
