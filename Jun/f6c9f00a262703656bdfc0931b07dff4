ELDERS and leaders of controversial prophet Shepherd Bushiri’s church, said the news of gospel artist Solly Moholo joining the Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG) church was still a mystery to them, as they had not been formally introduced to him. Moholo, who has spent his singing career belting his Zion Christian Church (ZCC) inspired songs Mokhukhu, had a change of heart and said he would be Bushiri’s disciple. The church which boasts thousands of congregants at the Pretoria showgrounds, said they were yet to learn of the news. Director of ECG Prophet Meshack said: “Today alone we have more than 60000 congregants and we have not been made aware of the artist in question joining the church. When the elders of the church have been informed or when we have seen him on our premises we will make you aware.” Meanwhile, ZCC church congregants, who were clad in their khaki church regalia, had opposing views about the news of Moholo’s switch.
