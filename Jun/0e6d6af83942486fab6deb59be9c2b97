Former eThekwini Municipal Manager Sibusiso Sithole has been appointed as the new Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa’s (PRASA) new Group CEO. Sithole has been with the parastatal since the beginning of the month. Prasa said that the new CEO has been brought into the organisation to bring stability and certainty on a one year contract. “Mr Sithole is quite aware of the immense challenges that are facing the organisation. Prasa is at its worst performance levels and there is an expectation from the public that we serve for the organization to turn itself around,” Chairperson of Prasa’s Board of Control Khanyisile Kweyama said. Kweyama said that the board does not expect the new CEO to have any difficulty in executing his duties. Sithole is described as a turnaround strategist and policy specialist who has held key positions in different government institutions including being General Manager at Umgeni Water Board and Xhuma Development Solutions. He also holds a Master’s in Education from the Manchester University in the UK and he is currently studying for his Doctorate on Business Administration with the Walden University in the USA. The Prasa board has urged employees to afford the new CEO with the necessary support to exercise his duties. Afro Voice Reporter
