A top ranking Limpopo government official and his rape accuser will both appear at the  Polokwane Magistrates court after they both laid charges against each other. The woman laid charges of rape against the official while he has laid counter charges of extortion against her. According to Limpopo police spokesperson Motlafela Mojapelo, the accused alleges that the alleged victim demanded R200 000 from him to keep her silence. In a statement issued by the Economic Freedom Fighter(EFF) where the party mentions the official’s name, the alleged rape took place at “one of the luxurious lodges in Polokwane on Friday. The victim who is alleged to be a Botswana national is allegedly doing volunteering work for the Cosafa Cup tournament at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium. The Cosafa Cup is currently taking place in the province. “Well, we can confirm that we have opened a charge of rape and a counter-charge of extortion. Rape against a senior government official and extortion against the woman and the cases are being investigated,” Mojapelo told the SABC. The EFF said the official knows very well the importance of international relations and the benefits that these games bring to the province. “He is supposed to be the first person to champion the interest of all stakeholders including their safety.” The party also called on the suspect to immediately tender his resignation with immediate effect and be suspended until the case is finalised. “We call upon the police to carry out their investigation and handling of the unfortunate incident without any fear or favour,” “In the interest of the province, it would be beneficial for him to relinquish his current position as he is now labelled as a danger to society,” the statement added. -Afro Voice Reporter
