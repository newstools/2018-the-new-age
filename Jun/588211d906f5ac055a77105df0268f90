Nine police officers including senior officials are expected to appear in the North West High Court for a pre-trial hearingÂ in relation to the Marikana massacre. About 34 miners were shot at by police during a protest in 13 August in 2012 in the North West province. The officers are facing four counts of murder, six attempted murder, defeating the ends of justice. The officers appeared before the court in March this year where they were granted bail. The criminal charges followed the recommendations by the Farlam commission of inquiry which was appointed by the former President Jacob Zuma to investigate the tragic incident at Lonmin Mine. The Marikana massacre led to the death of about 34 miners allegedly gunned down by the police and 78 injured after violence broke out during the strike by thousands of rock drill operators at the mine. -Afro Voice Reporter
