TOMORROW we will again commemorate one of the most significant dates in the history of our struggle for freedom and democracy, June 16. If we cast our minds back to that fateful day in 1976 and understand the way events unfolded we will be reminded that this day did not just happen out of the blue. There was a significant lead up to the events that unfolded that day that involved emerging youth leaders organising around the issue of the hated imposition of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction for all subjects. In the months leading up to June 16 some Soweto schools were already mounting school boycotts and refusing to be taught in Afrikaans. Apartheid’s security forces and police, during the June of ’76, seemed unprepared for the outpouring of anger that occurred that day and when they responded with such brutal and deadly force against school children they shocked the whole world. The heroes of ’76, both the known leaders and the unsung heroes, all have a special place in our history. Now, decades later we have young people who have built on the freedom that was fought for by the bravest of the brave including the young people of ’76. We now have young people doing all kinds of wonderful things, working in business, academia, politics, playing sport at international level, contributing to arts, music and fashion and making the nation proud in so many different ways. While we celebrate this we must also commit ourselves to accelerating the pace of transformation on all fronts, especially as regards the economy. We have to use all our power to address the plight of people who are still suffering from inequality, unemployment and poverty, by doing this we will truly honour the generation of ’76
