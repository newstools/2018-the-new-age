THE South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) has said its members are ready to down tools. Speaking to Afro Voice, the union’s general secretary Simon Mathe said the employer, the South African Local Government Association (Salga) was being unfair. “We will approach the CCMA for mediation and if that fails we will embark on industrial action. We will go through all processes in terms of the law,” he said. The negotiations broke down on Thursday after Samwu rejected the 7% wage offer. Mathe said they were demanding an 8% to 10% wage hike after they had brought down their demands from 15%. “The claims by Salga that our demands are unaffordable are far from the truth,” he said. Mathe said the wasteful expenditure of municipalities amounted to billions. “Municipal workers cannot be blamed for the mess which municipalities find themselves in. “For this reason we are forging ahead with our initial demands in the interest of our members who are facing a financial onslaught on all fronts,” he said. Mathe said the employer was arrogant and not willing to meet them halfway. Meanwhile Salga said the workers were the biggest losers in the collapse of the negotiations. “Salga is of the view that the dilly-dallying by Samwu will end in the workers being the biggest losers if one considers the constrained financial environment municipalities are operating in,” spokesperson Sivuyile Mbambato said. He said they hoped the union would reconsider its stance and return to the negotiating table. The union has a membership of 150000 members across most of the municipalities in the country. Meanwhile, the department of cooperative governance Minister Zweli Mkhize said more than 100 municipalities were dysfunctional. He said urgent attention was needed before they collapsed. -TIISETSO MANOKO|tiisetsom@afrotone.co.za
