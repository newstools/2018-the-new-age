SuperSport have announced the findings of the investigation of the incident that took place in their studio in May when Ashwin Willemse walked off during a live broadcast. Willemse walked out while he, Nick Mallett and Naas Botha were reviewing a match between the Golden Lions and Brumbies. Willemse accused Nick and Naas of undermining and patronising him. SuperSport CEO Gideon Khobane told the media on Tuesday that there was no racism involved in the incident that caused Willemse to walk out. “The conduct of Naas and Nick during an off-air conversation with Ashwin and during the live studio broadcast of the post-match commentary of the match does not manifest naked racism and was not motivated by racists considerations. “Secondly, assisted by prof Habib he also found that there was no evidence of Naas and Nick exhibiting either intended or unintended racism,” said Khobane. Khobane said did not participate in the investigation process. “I still see a place for Ashwin at Supersport. I would like to engage with him to further understand his viewpoint because he decided not to participate in the process, but however its important for us not to close the door on Ashwin because we still believe he has a value to add,” he said. Khobane said that they would offer counseling to all the parties involved due to the emotional suffering they might have endured. He said Supersport will also take the report to South African Human Rights Commission. -Afro Voice Reporter
