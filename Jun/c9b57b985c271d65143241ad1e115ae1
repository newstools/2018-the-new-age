City of Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille‘s lawyer Dali Mpofu has told the full bench of the Western Cape High Court that her client will step down as a mayor if the Democratic Alliance (DA) agrees to clear her name. Mpofu on Monday accused the DA of adopting an illegal shortcut to fire her from the party arguing that de Lille was appointed by the City Council and it should be the one to remove her as mayor. Last month the High Court set aside the party’s decision to remove de Lille as a Mayor and revoke her party membership. The party’s federal executive had cited a radio interview where she told a Talk Radio 702 host Eusebius Mckaiser that she would leave the party under certain conditions. The party had turned to section 3.5.1.2 of its constitution to get rid of De Lille citing that her public declarations about her intention to resign from the party, was against party rules. However, following last months court ruling, De Lille was reinstated as mayor despite a DA federal executive resolution to endorse a Cape Town metro caucus decision to fire her. De Lille is currently in court challenging aspects of the DA’s constitution adopted during the party’s Federal Congress in April, which make it easier for the party to fire members which may have brought the party into disrepute. On Thursday, the party’s caucus in the city tabled a motion to take some powers from the executive mayor, but De Lille retorted saying the move was tantamount to the baaskap mentality and similar to carrying a pas book where ever she went. -Afro Voice Reporter
