Limpopo Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba has on Monday clarified comments she reportedly made during a meeting between the department and Moutse Health Crisis Committee in April, that ‘Aids is a black people disease’. Ramathuba said the report was unfortunate and had not quoted her in the correct context. She told Power FM that the report does not only demonize her as the MEC but also perpetuated the stigma for HIV patients. “I have quoted what SANAC [South African National AIDS Council] Society in their press statement have said that Aids is prevalent amongst black communities. However, money that is supposed to treat HIV and Aids it is in the hands of the whites and that is true.” According to reports, a discriminatory complaint was filed at the Equality Court last week following that meeting with the Moutse Health Crisis Committee. However, the MEC said she is being taken to court for saying that HIV and Aids is prevalent amongst black, however, the money is in the white’s people’s hands. She said that for this, she is prepared to defend herself in court. Ramathuba said that when she has dialogues with black girls at institutions of higher education, the ‘blesser’ phenomenon is more prevalent where the girls end up being infected with HIV by these older partners. “It is not happening amongst the young white girls, that is a fact.” -Afro Voice Reporter
