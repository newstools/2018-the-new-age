The father who shot his 16-year-old son accidentally at Norman Fred Clark Secondary School in Ennerdale has been released on a warning. Sibusiso Emmanuel Tshabalala (50) asked the magistrate Maggie van der Merwe to grant him bail in order for him to help with the funeral preparation for his son. The distraught Tshabalala appeared at the Lenasia Magistrates Court. During the court appearance, Tshabalala could be seen being comforted by his visibly distraught wife. Speaking through his lawyer, he told the court that he was the only one employed at home and that he had three more children who depended on him for financial support. He also told the court that the accused was not a flight risk and that he held a permanent post, which meant that he would not skip bail. Tshabalala allegedly shot his son Luyanda Themba Tshabalala who was doing Grade 11 on the school grounds after mistaking him for a highjacker when he knocked on the window on Tuesday night. According to his affidavit which was read in court, he went to school to collect his son after attending extra lessons when he fell asleep in his car. The case will resume again on July 24. -Afro Voice Reporter
