Power utility Eskom is on Tuesday expected to begin fresh wage negotiations with its employees after negotiations broke down last week. The power utility had initially told its employee that it could not afford to give a salary increase, citing financial difficulties. However, the matter went back to the boardroom after Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan’s intervention. On Monday reports surfaced that the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) called for the postponement of wage negotiations with Eskom because of its congress this week, but the union dismissed those reports. “The NUM congress is starting on Wednesday at the Birchwood Hotel and that will not affect the wage negotiations as there will be another team from the NUM that will fully participate in the wage negotiations,” the union said. At the same time, Num also dismissed suggestion by Eskom that its members were responsible for the recent load shedding. Power utility claims striking NUM members were involved in acts of intimation against workers who did not support their action. Num’s Chief Negotiator Helen Diapile says Eskom is desperate to shift the blame for load shedding, saying that the utility will point at anything, but them. “If the investigation confirms reports that our members were involved in acts of intimidation during the strike they will be disciplined by their branches,” Diapile said. He further said they hoping for cordial engagements with Eskom with negotiations today (Tuesday). -Afro Voice Reporter
