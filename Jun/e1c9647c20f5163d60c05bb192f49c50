AUDITING firm KPMG has hit another snag after last week becoming embroiled in a decade-long brawl between the “please call me” inventor Nkosana Makate and Vodacom. Makate claimed KPMG was holding back a forensic report and in doing so was helping to cover for Vodacom. In a radio interview, Makate said he had lodged a request with KPMG for information contained in a 2008 forensic report which would help in negotiations between himself and Vodacom. He said he had appealed to the CEO and chairperson of KPMG and that the report uncovered breaches of governance at Vodacom. “I believe the KPMG report will assist me in getting payment from Vodacom for my invention,” he said. In 2016, the Constitutional Court ruled in favour of Makate in a legal battle which centred on his lack of compensation from Vodacom following the success of the Please Call Me application. The court ruled that Vodacom was bound by an agreement it had with Makate and ordered him to be compensated. He said all he was looking for s a fair share of profits from Vodacom. “Vodacom does not want me to talk about this issue. We are going back to the drawing board in the next two months to try to finalise this matter,” he said. In response to Makate’s claim, KPMG said Makate had applied to KPMG, under provisions of the Promotion of Access to Information Act, to release a report that they had prepared for a client. “We complied with those provisions, but were unable to release the report without the client’s consent, which was not given. “As a result, we advised Makate that he would need to bring an application to court to compel KPMG to release the report as we had no authority to do so without a court order. The two court orders he refers to are against the client and KPMG was not involved in those proceedings,” KPMG spokesperson Ngubeko Sibiya said. Efforts to get comment from Vodacom yesterday were fruitless. -BERNARD SATHEKGE|bernards@afrotone.co.za
