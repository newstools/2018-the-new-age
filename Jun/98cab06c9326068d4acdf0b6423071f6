COMMUNITY safety, security and liaison management in the province has called on immoral police officers to voluntarily tender their resignations. They said the community deserves to be served by those who are dedicated and have compassion for the job. Community, safety, security and liaison MEC, Pat Ngomane, also paid his last respects to the late Maj-Gen Ellias Dlamini in Mbombela at the weekend. The senior police officer who was a cluster commander for Pienaar and surrounding areas near Mbombela, was killed in an accident a week ago. He had served the police force for about 34 years and was about to retire in April next year. Ngomane said the deceased did not only serve in the police because of unemployment but he regarded the job as a calling and served the community with loyalty. He said other police officers needed to take off where the deceased had left off in order to remain committed and deliver with distinction. “It is for that reason that we honour him for serving the community with a lot of commitment. Corrupt police officers do not belong to the police force or in the community but in jail. “Those who have no passion for policing must leave the force and allow those who want to work to come in. We are tired of police officers who join the force because of unemployment and end up committing crimes and tarnishing the good work the others are doing,” Ngomane said. -FRANCE NYAKA|francen@afrotone.co.za
