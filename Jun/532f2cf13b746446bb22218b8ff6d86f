Parliaments standing committee on Finance says the role of Public Investment Corporation (PIC) is to create economic growth, transformation, and job-creation goals. In an effort to make the PIC fulfil its role effectively and transparently, the committee is currently processing both a private member’s Bill and a committee Bill relating to the PIC. Standing Committee chairperson Yunus Carrim said the committee met with the PIC nine times over the past nine months and met with the entity many times more than any other that falls under the Finance Committee. “At our last meeting on 5 June, we requested the PIC board, under its new chairperson, Deputy Minister Mr Mondli Gungubele, to investigate all the allegations in the public domain and report back to Parliament in the third quarter of the year,” Carrim said. This comes after, reports that PIC had invested R4.3bn in Ayo Technology Solutions as part of an initial public offering in December 2017 without consulting the board. However, the entities Deon Botha had promised to look into the matter to ensure that investment processes were followed.  -Afro Voice Reporter
