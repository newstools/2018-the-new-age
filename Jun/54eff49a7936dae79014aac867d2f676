Bafana Bafana striker Luther Singh is excited to work with the exciting bunch of players they have in the national team for the Cosafa Cup in Polokwane and feels that if they can work together well they can win the tournament. Bafana start their tournament tomorrow with a quarterfinal match against the winner of Group A which consists of Mozambique, Seychelles, Comoros and Madagascar. Singh said he is pleased with the commitment shown by the players in training as they prepare for their first match. “I think there is a good mixture of young and senior players,” Singh said. “We have players who have represented the country at the highest level and players in their respective clubs in South Africa performing well. “It is a good group and moving forward we can do well in the tournament if we can work together as a team and not as individuals.” Having impressed for his team Braga B in Portugal this past season and being promoted to the first team for the upcoming campaign, the 20-year-old wants to bring that performance to Bafana at Cosafa Cup. “It is always good. I’m happy to be back and it is an honour to be here again to represent the nation. “It’s been a while, I mean with the talent we have in the country you never know who will be called up for the national team. “For my part, I have always worked hard because it will always be an honour for me to play for Bafana. When the time comes, I will just have to work extra hard, improving myself and making myself a better player. I knew that the opportunity would come again so it was just a matter of time and being patient.” Singh also said he has been enjoying working with Bafana coach Stuart Baxter and he likes what he has seen at training. “This is my first time working with him and we’ve had good tactical sessions.” nevillek@afrotone.co.za
