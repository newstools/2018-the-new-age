The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has expressed concern over an increasing number of fake SMSes that have been circulated to beneficiaries. This follows reports of a recent SMS instructing beneficiaries to re-register their social grants because cash pay points will be fully phased-out by August 2018. Sassa spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi said that the content of the SMS is misleading and is causing unnecessary confusion and panic among social grants beneficiaries. “We urge all beneficiaries to ignore this message as it is incorrect.” Contrary to this SMS, she added that the beneficiaries do not have to re-register their grants but they are requested to swap their old Sassa cards for the new ones by end of September 2018. “This can be done at local Sassa offices, pay points or selected Post Offices. Furthermore, Sassa would like to clarify that cash pay points will be gradually reduced and not fully phased out as alleged in the SMS,” Letsatsi said. Minister of Social Development Susan Shabangu has called on beneficiaries to be aware of such messages and further encouraged them to contact Sassa visit their nearest office should they have doubts about any messages they receive. The Fake SMS reads as follows: “All Sassa recipients, please you have to re-register yourself for Sassa payments. From 1st of June. There is will be no paypoints anymore. Each 1 has to apply by the post office or a bank of your choice. So please collect application forms by the office from the 1st of June to take to bank or post office your choice. If you do not re-register you will not get paid in August or thereafter.
Please share with all state pensioners. Thank you.” -Afro Voice Reporter
