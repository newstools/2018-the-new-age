The City of Johannesburg has announced that it has given the African National Congress (ANC) until Friday to pay the city a R300 000 legal bill incurred by the ANC following the failed motion of no confidence against mayor Herman Mashaba last year. Mashaba says that the metro’s lawyers brought the matter to his attention on Monday that the ANC has until Friday to settle the amount, failing which the city will institute legal proceedings to have items to the value of R300 000 from the ANC headquarters attached. “The city has instructed its lawyers to proceed with the execution of the court order. We have been asking the ANC nicely for the past 8/9 months for them to pay our costs,” said Mashaba. Last year the ANC brought an urgent application to the South Gauteng High court to have the tabled motion of no confidence against Mashaba and the speaker conducted through a secret ballot. The court struck the ANC’s application off the roll and ordered that it pays the legal fees. Mashaba says that if the ANC is concerned about the financial viability of the city, they should pay the bill. “This is not my money, this is the public’s money,” said Mashaba. Attempts to reach ANC national spokesperson, Pule Mabe were unsuccessful at the time of publishing. -AfroVoice Reporter
