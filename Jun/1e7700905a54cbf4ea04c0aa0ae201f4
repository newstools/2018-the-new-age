THE ANC in the Western Cape believes that Premier Helen Zille will fall when it brings a motion of no confidence against her and also if Western Cape legislature speaker Sharna Fernandez allows a secret ballot on the vote. The ANC made the comments after Fernandez was ordered by public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to act in 30 days and hold Zille to account for her tweets about colonialism. Spokesperson for the legislature, Ernst Odendaal, said that Fernandez had not received the public protector’s report and could not comment on the matter. However, acting ANC chairperson Khaya Magaxa said it was clear that the DA had finally woken up to the reality that Zille had become a liability. “The regret expressed by (DA leader) Mmusi Maimane on not acting strongly against Helen Zille is now widely shared and the DA’s provincial caucus is also showing signs of Zille fatigue. “It is likely that when we bring a vote of no confidence against Zille and the speaker allows a secret ballot, Helen Zille will go.” If Zille has any dignity left in her, she does not have to wait for that humiliation, he said. “As the ANC we ask Helen Zille to do the right thing and resign as the Premier,”he said. Magaxa said the ANC in the Western Cape welcomed the public protector’s report on Zille. “As the ANC we lodged a complaint with the public protector against Zille for violating the Executive Ethics Act with her gravely offensive and reckless tweets which polarised our community and drove deeper the racial wedge of our past,” he said. -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN|news@afrotone.co.za
