The South African Airways (SAA) Chief Executive Officer Vuyani Jarana told Parliament’s Finance Committee on Thursday that negative reports from the media are undermining the airline’s strategy as markets are sensitive. Jarana said he understands the need for transparency, adding that market sentiment needs to be considered. He further said reducing passenger numbers in the domestic market is part of the airline’s strategy. “We are trying to “outsource” our pilots to other airlines as a way to preserve jobs during its flight reduction strategy,” Jarana said. Jarana revealed that the strengthening of the rand accounted for R419m of the R900m revenue losses, but he, however, said it helped with cost savings of R656m. Meanwhile, SAA board chairperson JB Magwaza said liquidity remains a challenge and that there are green shoots at the airline. Last week the committee cancelled the meeting over a dispute whether it should be held behind closed doors or not. According to reports, the board prepared itself to present its strategy during a closed session, which acting committee chairperson Thandi Tobias and the African National Congress (ANC) supported, saying the decision was taken during the committee’s previous sitting. However, Democratic Alliance (DA) members on the committee, Alf Lees and David Mainier denied that the committee had taken that decision and insisted that the airline deliver its presentation in an open session, ‘in the interest of transparency’. -Afro Voice Reporter
