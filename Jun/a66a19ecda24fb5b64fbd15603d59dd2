Another cash-in-transit heist took place on Monday morning at the Jakes Gerwel Drive, near Hanover Park in Cape Town. The police have closed the road after two G4S cash vans were blown-up by robbers. This is the first cash-in-transit heist since the police Minister Bheki Cele announced a clampdown on CIT robberies about two weeks ago. It is not yet clear if anyone has been injured during the incident or the amount of cash that has been taken.
