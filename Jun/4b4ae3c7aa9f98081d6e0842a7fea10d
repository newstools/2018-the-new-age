The Ndebele Appeals Panel Report on last year’s disputed ANC Eastern Cape Provincial Conference has recommended that the Provincial executive committee elected at the conference be suspended. The report also recommended for the “re-run of the 8th [Eastern Cape] provincial elective conference within 3 months,” This emerged as the ANC is set to hold its NEC meeting on Monday amidst disputes in several provinces, including legal challenges in KwaZulu-Natal. The report has also recommended for the Branch General Meetings’s in those branches which lodged the claims of irregularity to be Re-run. Last year in the run up to its 54th National Confrence, chaos broke out during the ANC Easten Cape confrence where Oscar Mabuyane was elected as the party’s provincial chairperson. Violence erupted at the conference, leaving several delegates injured. Some delegates had claimed non-members attempted to participate in proceedings while other legitimate members had been barred from the conference. Meanwhile the Ndebele Report has recommended that Mabuyane and former Provinicial Chairperson, Phumulo Masualle lead the unification and healing process as members of the interim structure. The report initially circulated in March purportedly written by Appeals panel chairman Sbusiso Ndebele who conducted investigations into the conference. Meanwhile some disgruntled ANC members from the West Rand are protesting outside the ANC NEC meeting. NEC member Senzo Mchunu addressed the members and promised that the Secretary-General Ace Magashule will respond to them in writing.  Ace Magashule :Magashule: KZN yes there are court actions but the PTT held by Mabuyakhulu and Sihle is doing well .
