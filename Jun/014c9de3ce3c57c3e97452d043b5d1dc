The newly elected KwaZulu-Natal Cosatu leadership said the much-awaited job summit must deal with challenges of over rising unemployment and job loss. The federation says the summit must not only look at the interest of elites and the few company bosses who want to make a profit through labour. “The summit must look at the plights of labour and workers. It must also be able to assist us on how to deal with issues of labour brokerage, and to be able to invest in workers lively-hood,” provincial chairperson Sikhumbuzo Mdlalose said. Mdlalose said Cosatu unions are tasked with the responsibility of defending workers, adding that as the federation they know that majority of workers were without unions. He said the congress emphasised that the issues of exemption clauses on Minimum wages need to be tightened so as to avoid employers from abusing exemption clauses from paying workers. The provincial Chairperson said that they commit themselves to further deepen the fight for a living wage as part of their commitment to improving the lives of workers. President Cyril Ramaphosa signed of the National Minimum wage agreement of R20 an hour last February in his capacity as leader of business then as he was deputy president. Ramaphosa made the announcement in Parliament, saying that all stakeholders had signed the agreement at the time except for Cosatu. “Cosatu was not present to sign the agreement as they asked to get time to complete an internal process of consultation,” he said. -Afro Voice Reporter
