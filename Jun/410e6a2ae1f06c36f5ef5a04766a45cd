The case against five men arrested in connection with a cash-in-transit heist in Boksburg in May is expected to resume at the Boksburg Magistrate’s Court in Johannesburg on Wednesday. The five men are facing charges of attempted murder, possession of unlicensed firearms, robbery with aggravating circumstances and possession of explosives. The suspects fled the scene with an undisclosed amount of money. This is their third court appearance. During their previous appearance, their defence team told the court that their clients were assaulted during their arrests. Meanwhile on Wednesday, the South African Police Service (SAPS) will be appearing in Parliament to outline the measures it is taking to combat the rising number of Cash in transit heists that have been experienced in the recent past. Last month, the Gauteng Community Safety MEC, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane revealed that there have been 96 cash-in-transit cases in Gauteng only in the past nine months. This is for the period from August 2017 to May 2018. Cash in transit drivers staged a protest on Tuesday in different parts of the country calling for government intervention over the increased number of cash in transit robberies. -AfroVoice Reporter
