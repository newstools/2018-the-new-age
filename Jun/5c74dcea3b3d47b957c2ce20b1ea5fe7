BANYANA Banyana coach Desiree Ellis has emphasised the need to score goals when they meet Lesotho in the first leg of their CAF Cup of Nation (AWC) qualifier this afternoon at Setsoto Stadium, Maseru, at 3pm. Ellis said scoring goals has been a major problem for the team and as they look to book their place in the AWC. She wants the players to be “ruthless in front of goal to kill off games”. Ellis has kept the bulk of the squad that played in the Cyprus Cup in March, while including three new faces, Karabo Dlamini, Khanya Xesi and Hilda Magaia. “One of the areas we addressed is the goal scoring, we’ve spoken about this on many occasions and we know this is a nery big year for us,” Ellis said. “We want to address that problem continually and I think the excitement among the players at the training sessions, with the goalkeeper making good saves and the players always trying to score, will bear fruit when it comes to actual match play against Lesotho. -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@afrotone.co.za
