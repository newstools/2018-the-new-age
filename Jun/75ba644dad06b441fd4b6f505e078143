The body of the fifth missing miner at the Sibanye-Stillwater‘s Kloof mine has been recovered on Thursday morning. “Sibanye-Stillwater advises that the mine rescue teams have located and retrieved the body of the fifth employee that went missing at its Kloof Ikamva mine. The bodies of all five employees who entered an abandoned area on Monday have now been recovered and sadly five colleagues lost their lives in this tragic accident,” Sibanye-Stillwater said in a statement. The mine said that a thorough investigation by the management, Department of Mineral resources (DMR) and other stakeholders will be performed to uncover the circumstances that led to this incident. This brings the total number of fatalities to five after the other four that passed away earlier week in the mine. The mineworkers succumbed to heat and gas exposure. On Monday, five miners entered an abandoned working area where four of the five miners passed away. The recent death has prompted the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) to call on the President Cyril Ramaphosa to intervene in amending mine safety legislation in order to curb the deaths at mines. Meanwhile, the Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe said that there is a big challenge for the government to stop the Kloof and Driefontein reef from becoming a killing field of the mining industry. Workers must take a responsibility in ensuring that they are safe. The employer has a legal obligation to provide a safe working place. The Inspectorate is here, #SibanyeStillwater. We will take decisions about the mine pic.twitter.com/6U5zsU4g0s — Gwede Mantashe (@GwedeMantashe1) June 12, 2018  -Afro Voice Reporter
