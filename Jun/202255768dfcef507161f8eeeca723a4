The African National Congress (ANC) in Gauteng has on Sunday called on authorities to ‘firmly deal’ with any acts of criminality that put the lives of hospital patients at risks following the recent strike at the Charlotte Maxeke hospital in Gauteng last week. This comes after the violent protest by protesting workers at the hospital filled the corridors with trash. It was also reported that patients were turned away during the protests. According to reports, workers were protesting over delayed payments and bonuses which have allegedly not been paid for two years. In a statement released on Sunday following the provincial executive committee (PEC) meeting that was held on Friday, the ANC in Gauteng called for the employer and the unions to find a solution in the matter. “We call on the authorities to deal firmly with any acts of criminality that put the lives of patients at risk. “At the same time, we call on the Gauteng Department of Health and the unions to find an urgent amicable solution to the current dispute on bonuses, in the best interests of patients. “The PEC has noted, with shock and disapproval, the unprecedented escalation of destructive and life-threatening industrial action among workers in the health sector where patients have now become the target,” the statement reads. Meanwhile, the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (NEHAWU) in a statement released on Friday said the union had met with the Gauteng Department of Health(GDA) to find and a solution on the payment of outstanding bonuses. According to Nehawu, the employer has agreed to pay the outstanding bonuses for the 2016/17 financial year. However, the union said the matter still has to be finalised during a special multilateral meeting which will be convened on June 5. -Afro Voice Reporter
