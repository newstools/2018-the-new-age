THE second instalment of social media-based edudrama series, Lives of Grace, starring Safa award-winning actress Zola Nombona, is back on WhatsApp messenger. This interactive drama follows the real life story of an ordinary South African woman faced with various obstacles. The drama series is played out almost completely through voice-notes, which Grace sends to her confidant (the subscriber), the subscriber is able to assist Grace in making some important life changing decisions. Last year, Uk’shona Kwelanga, starring veteran stage and TV actress ThembiMtshali-Jones, reached a total of 44000 subscribers and received more than 30 million impressions. It was written by acclaimed script writer Bongi Ndaba, who is back for the second time with this innovative collaboration with Sanlam Developing Markets, who last year took the bold move of beginning an often taboo conversation around death and funerals on social media. Fresh from dazzling audiences as part of Dancing with the Stars competition, Nombona, who is best known for roles in TV shows such as Lockdown, Z’bondiwe and Intersextions, reacted with excitement over the new venture. “Acting purely through voice was very different – so much needed to be conveyed just through speech,” she said. “And it needed to sound conversational as though I was talking to a trusted friend. I loved this project for two reasons – the challenge of acting via an entirely new medium and the fact that the script resonated with me on many levels. Nombona said like most people, she knew what it felt like to be responsible for loved ones and knew what it was like to lose people and to share and bear the financial costs of this. “I think it’s interesting to watch Grace’s journey play out and be part of it. You get to make Grace’s decisions and see their consequences, reflect on the choices you make and understand the implications of these,” she said. -SIYABONGA SITHOLE|siyabongas@afrotone.co.za
