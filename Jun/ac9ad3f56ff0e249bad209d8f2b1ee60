Mohamed Salah was not included in Egypt’s starting line-up for their World Cup opener against Uruguay on Friday following his shoulder injury. The star striker, who turned 26 on Friday, suffered the injury three weeks ago in Liverpool’s Champions League defeat to Real Madrid. On the eve of the Uruguay match, Egypt coach Hector Cuper said Salah was fit, raising Egyptian hopes that he would start the Group A clash. AFP
