LAND targeted for expropriation without compensation will be strategically located, backed by an expressed need, or unutilised. These are some of the conditions that will be taken into account for expropriation, Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, said. She gave this reply in response to a written parliamentary question from DA MP Ken Robertson who had asked her whether the government had determined and/or developed measures to determine which land would be earmarked for expropriation without compensation and if not, by what date would that determination be made. Nkoana-Mashabane said: “In his state of the nation address, President Cyril Ramaphosa clearly stated: ‘Expropriation without compensation should be implemented in a way that increases agricultural production, improves food security and ensures that the land is returned to those from whom it was taken under colonialism and apartheid. The government will undertake a process of consultation to determine the modalities of the implementation of this resolution’.” She said the Regulation of Agricultural Land Bill, published for public comment in March last year, further outlined the broad criteria. There is a project to refine such criteria, consider the determinations and policy options and advise accordingly. -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
