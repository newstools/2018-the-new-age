KESHAV Maharaj and Tabraiz Shamsi have been called up for South Africa’s ODI squad to play Sri Lanka next month. Veteran spinner Imran Tahir, who will be 40 years old when the ICC World Cup begins in England next year, has been left out. The Proteas decided to rest Tahir as they look to give both Maharaj and Shamsi a look in. The series in Sri Lanka consists of five ODIs and a T20 and will form part of the preparations for the World Cup. With AB de Villiers now retired, Cricket South Africa also called up uncapped Reeza Hendricks, wicketkeeper batsman Heinrich Klaasen and Aiden Markram. Faf du Plessis will return as captain after missing five of the six ODIs against India earlier this year due to a broken finger. Junior Dala, who has played three international T20s, has also been included and will likely take the place of Morne Morkel, also retired. Convener of selectors Linda Zondi explained the reasons for leaving Tahir out. “We have taken the strategic decision to rest Tahir so that we can get a clearer picture as to who our best second spinner is to back him up at the World Cup,” Zondi said. “Imran will be our first choice spinner at the World Cup but, if we play him against Sri Lanka, it is unlikely that we will be able to play both Tabraiz Shamsi and Keshav Maharaj. “By taking this route, we will be able to play the two of them together. Tabraiz has been the outstanding bowler in franchise white ball cricket this past season. “And Keshav has been outstanding for us in red ball cricket and we need to give him the opportunity to show us what he can do at international level in the ODI format.” -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@afrotone.co.za
