WESTERN Cape MEC for health Nomafrench Mbombo and George mayor Melvin Naik officially opened the long-awaited local clinic in Thembalethu yesterday. The R61m medical facility is meant to render services to the local community, including the surrounding areas in George. “The clinic is brought to your doorstep for everyone to use. We call on all to safeguard it. The purpose of this clinic is to bring better health services to the people,” Mbombo said. The facility was hailed by residents who in previous years had to travel long distances to get medical care. A resident, Nomthunzi Xhapha, 56, who takes regular treatment for arthritis, said the facility was built at a convenient spot for everyone to get to. “It is in the centre of the township and accessible to all. I used to travel a distance to the clinic in another section but now I don’t have to do that because it is close to our houses,” she said. “We no longer have to stand in line for long hours because this clinic seems to have so many rooms and we hope they will employ enough staff. “The medical facility seems fine and everything is in order. We hope everything will be fine.” -MPUMI KIVA
