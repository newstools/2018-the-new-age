THE Department of Basic Education has rubbished claims that the recommendation by the ministerial task team into the possible introduction of history as a compulsory subject is an attempt by the government to spread propaganda. “It’s outrageous, preposterous and disappointing that anybody would be suspicious about the work of an independent team that did the research into this matter. “The task team’s work was transparent and open and members of the public were invited. “There’s no hidden agenda in this matter,” the department’s spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said. The FF+ chairperson and parliamentary spokesperson for Basic Education, advocate Anton Alberts said the recommendation was illconsidered and would serve simply as a means for the government to spread its propaganda among young pupils. “The current history syllabus is a one-sided distortion of South Africa’s history that demonises white people. “This method of spreading the ANC government’s rhetoric, ideology and propaganda among the youth is nothing but a bold step in the direction of a Marxist state, reminiscent of Stalin,” Alberts said. -SHONISANI TSHIKALANGE|shonisanit@afrotone.co.za
