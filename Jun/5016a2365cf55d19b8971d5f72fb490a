Garbine Muguruza roared into the French Open semi-finals with a 6-2 6-1 demolition job of Maria Sharapova on Wednesday. The predicted battle royal between the two former champions never materialised on a muggy Court Philippe Chatrier as Spaniard Muguruza dominated from start to finish. Sharapova looked nervous from the beginning and was never allowed to settle as Muguruza posted her first victory against the Russian at the fourth attempt. An anti-climactic match ended in predictable fashion with a Sharapova backhand into the net. Muguruza, winner two years ago, will face either world number one Simona Halep or Angelique Kerber in the semi-finals. -Reuters
