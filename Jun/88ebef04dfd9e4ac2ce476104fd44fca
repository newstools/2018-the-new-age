The Northern Cape Acting Provincial Commissioner Major General Koliswa Otola has commended the investigating officer Detective Sergeant Molaeng and NPA for their efforts in making sure that the man accused of killing ‘Hero Boy’ Kutlwano Garesape was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. The Northern Cape High Court handed Tefelo Dikole,31, a life sentence for the murder of Garesape and seven years for attempted rape of his mother. Otola said that the six-year-old Garesape was named ‘Hero Boy’ for dying while defending his mother in August 2016. “Kutlwano was described as a “Hero Boy” for the reason that on the day in which he was murdered, he took it upon himself to defend his mother when Dikole attempted to rape her.” Otola said that on the day of the gruesome atrocity, Garesape and his mother were walking near the railway line in Jankempdorp on their way to school when Dikole approached them and grabbed her in an attempt to rape her. He said when Garesape tried to defend his mother, the accused stabbed him to death. “Tefo appeared to be very oblivious in court and did not seem to be aware of what was happening around his world, he seemed to be in the world of his own.” Otola said the harsh and hefty jail term brings and restore hope to victims of crime to continue to believe in the justice system of this country. Garesape would have been 8-year-old on the 5th of this month. -Afro Voice Reporter
