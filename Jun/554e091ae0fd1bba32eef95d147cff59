DEPUTY President David Mabuza will have to tell Parliament whether any current or future agreements regarding nuclear power was made with Vladimir Putin’s government during his recent visit to Russia. Last month, President Cyril Ramaphosa sent Mabuza to Russia as his special envoy. In a weekend interview Energy Minister Jeff Radebe said there was no nuclear deal with Russia. But MPs want to hear that news in Parliament directly from the president’s emissary to Russia. Next Wednesday, Mabuza will have to share the purpose of his Russian journey with the National Council of Provinces in a question-andanswer session. DA MP Bronwynn Engelbrecht has lined up a series of questions based on that visit. She wants to know what was discussed with President Putin and also with the Russian government regarding the nuclear deal. Engelbrecht has also asked “whether any current or future agreements were made regarding nuclear power?” ANC MP Seiso Mohai will want to know from the deputy president if the government is meeting the targets that were set to ensure that the Community Works Programme (CWP) employs 1 million persons by 2019. He has also inquired what impact CWP was making in assisting the government’s initiatives to create jobs, especially for the youth and women. Mohai is also seeking clarity on future plans to expand CWP “as a strategic employment safety net, especially for the youth, women, the poor and downtrodden”. -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
