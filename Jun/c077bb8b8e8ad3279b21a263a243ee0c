The African National Conference (ANC) hopes to reconvene its KwaZulu-Natal provincial elective conference before the end of July. This comes after the conference which was scheduled to take place between 8-10 June was interdicted by some disgruntled members in the province. Speaking on Saturday, Provincial coordinator Sihle Zikalala said that they hoped to reconvene the conference in 6 weeks. “With regard to the provincial conference, having cleared all of the issues that were raised through the court, through organizational processes. We would want to reconvene the conference, we will see when, but the mandate given by branches which will be decided by the national officials and the National Executive Committee (NEC), was that we should convene in 6 weeks,” said Zikala. Following the court interdict, the ANC had planned to hold a consultative conference which was also called off after chaos erupted where ANC chairperson Gwede Mantashe was also prevented from addressing the gathering. Zikalala said that with the mandate given by the delegates, they would be going to court on Monday to present their case with regard to the court interdict. “We will engage with the court, seek to apply for an early return to present ourselves and our case on matters raised, we will be applying for that on Monday, that is what we have been instructed by delegates to do,” he said. Zikala said that they would also be engaging with branches that have raised their concerns. -Afro Voice Reporter
