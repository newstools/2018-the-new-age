The DA has threatened a motion of no confidence against KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu should he not suspend provincial MEC of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Nomusa Dube-Ncube after making corruption allegations against her. On Wednesday morning DA KZN leader Zwakele Mncwango alleged that Dube-Ncube benefitted, Brand Partners, a company allegedly owned by her husband, Sibusiso Dube to the tune of R7.7 million. The company allegedly was appointed to provide communication services to the Nkandla municipality while flouting supply chain management procedure as well as without the provincial treasury’s authority. The DA has further alleged that the MEC facilitated the appointment of Nkandla municipal manager, Langelihle Jili despite him not being properly qualified for the position as well as the improper appointment of Philani Sibiya as Mthonjaneni municipal manager. “While the DA has long been aware of wide-scale corruption within KZN’s municipalities, the fact that the MEC herself is now at the centre of such a corruption is unprecedented.” “The DA expects the MEC to explain exactly how and why her husband came to be awarded these contracts and why both of these municipal managers were appointed in spite of irregularities,” said Mncwango. The DA has since given Premier Willies Mchunu seven days to respond to its call that Dube-Ncube is suspended as well as suspend the two municipal managers. -Afro Voice Reporter
