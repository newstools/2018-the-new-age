City of Joburg Emergency Services has called on motorists to exercise maximum caution when they drive on the N12 West near Xavier Street off-ramp following a bus accident which claimed two lives. According to City of Joburg Emergency Services spokesperson Nana Radebe, two people lost their lives when the bus carrying over 60 passengers travelling from Umtata to Germiston overturned in the early hours of the morning. Radebe said 30 people have been taken to hospital with various injuries. “Three people sustained very serious injuries while others sustained minor injuries and we are hoping they will be discharged from hospital soon.” Radebe said all four lanes of the road remain closed as the bus company is busy retrieving the wreckage and all the passengers’ belongings. “What is still delaying us is the company… it said their people will be here soon to collect the wreckage for their own investigations,” she said. -Afro Voice Reporter
