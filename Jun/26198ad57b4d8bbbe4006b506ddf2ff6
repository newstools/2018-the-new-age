You were f****g me while I was paying damages, Baby mama stressed up we was in Los Angeles, Possing for the cameras acting like some savages, savages everywhere we went we was no main event, I know this song gonna wake up the internet, I had a dream like dejavu.” In a Tweet on Monday, AKA says that the way that other people had been carrying on about the track was as if he was the first person to release a song about a woman. The way some people are carrying on, you’d swear that I’m the 1st artist to write a song about a woman. — AKA (@akaworldwide) June 4, 2018  Some of Bonang’s fans were left fuming about the diss song and took to Twitter to vent their frustrations while other fans liked it.
