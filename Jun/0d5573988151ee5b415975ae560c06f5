KwaZulu-Natal police have on Tuesday condemned the killing of a 54-year-old Warrant Officer who was shot and killed in Isipingo. It is sad that the police officer on Monday was in his vehicle with a companion when they were attacked by at least six unknown suspects. Acting Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi says police won’t rest until they apprehend the suspects. “We will not rest until the perpetrators of this abhorrent crime are brought to book. The Provincial Organised Crime Unit has been tasked to investigate this case and ensure that those involved are arrested. I wish to convey my sincere condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of the police officer. I appeal to the community to assist our investigators by exposing those behind this heinous crime. One can only imagine what sort of terror these thugs will unleash in our communities if they are so bold to kill an officer of the law so callously,” Mkhwanazi said. The off-duty cop died on the scene while his companion was left wounded. The police officers firearm was taken by the suspects before they fled the scene in their getaway vehicle. Last month Gauteng Police management vowed to apprehend the killers of Meadowlands police station commander, Brigadier Malefetsana Mofokeng. Mofokeng was attacked after arriving at his home in the evening. He was approached by unknown suspects who then shot him. -Afro Voice Reporter
