Eskom has announced that it has commenced with Stage one of load shedding on Friday. The power utility said that this is due to the impact of the current illegal protest action by some of Eskom Employees at various sites. However, it said that it is working with relevant stakeholders to keep its plant operating optimally even though there are high chances of load shedding over the weekend. Meanwhile, the City of Cape Town has called on residents to keep power consumption low to avoid load shedding and to ensure that they operating on the schedule as before. The City’s Mayoral Committee Member for informal Settlements Water and Waste Services Cllr Zanthea Limberg said that as power consumption increases during peak hours, power will need to be conserved and residents will need to familiarise themselves with the schedule to know when to expect a power cut in their area. “We are waiting on Eskom to inform us of what their generation capacity will be, however, we believe that there is a risk that load shedding will continue to be implemented throughout next week.” Eskom calls on all consumers to assist by reducing their electricity consumption by switching off geysers, electric heating, pool pumps, and all non-essential appliances throughout the day. -Afro Voice Reporter
