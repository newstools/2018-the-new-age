Residents of Vuwani Township Limpopo have given Limpopo MEC for Co-operative Governance Jerry Ndou a 14 days deadline to report back to the community with feedback on demarcation disputes in the area. This comes after the announcement of another shutdown and demonstrations in the area, which were expected to start on Monday. Residents have been engaged in several protests in the past three years over dissatisfaction following the recommendation by the Municipal Demarcation Board (MDB) for Vuwani to be merged with Malamulele to form a new municipality.
