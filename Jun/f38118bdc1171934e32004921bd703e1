Top Limpopo government official and his rape accuser have both withdrawn charges against each other. The official had also opened a case of extortion against the woman, accusing her of demanding R200 000 from him to keep her silence about the encounter. The complainant is allegedly a Botswana national who is doing volunteering for her country during the Cosafa Cup tournament which is currently underway in Limpopo. According to the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the province, the alleged rape took place at one of the upmarket resorts in Polokwane. According to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), they received written statements from both the alleged victim and perpetrator informing the authority about the intention to withdraw the charges against each other. NPA spokesperson Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi said the official withdrawal statement will then be submitted to the National Director of Public Prosecutions. “We can’t say what is written on both the statements. But the NDPP is the one who will have a final say on the matter.” -Afro Voice Reporter
