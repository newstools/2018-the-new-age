AGISANANG township in Sannieshof, outside Mahikeng, hosts the provincial campaign that seeks to warn residents against polluting the environment. The campaign will start Friday to cap off sustained efforts to raise awareness on the importance of environmental cleanliness. For weeks, the campaigners have visited different areas, particularly in the Tswaing municipality where problems have been raised on waste management. Rural, environment and agricultural development MEC Manketsi Tlhape will lead the proceedings. Department spokesperson Emelda Setlhako said: “This year’s provincial campaign on environment promotes awareness on the importance of preserving biodiversity and encourages communities to protect the environment to avoid environmental degradation.” She said the campaign theme is Beating Plastic Pollution. MEC Tlhape will give refuse bins to child-headed families, as well as disadvantaged households in the area. “The campaign will culminate in a three-day youth camp in Baberspan with more education on saving the environment,” Setlhako said. It will be held at the Agisanang Township Stadium at 9am. -ELFAS TORERAI|elfast@afrotone.co.za
