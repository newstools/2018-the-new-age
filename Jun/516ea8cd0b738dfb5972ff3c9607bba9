Majority of municipalities are unable to pay Eskom because of bloated staff wage bill the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) heard on Wednesday. Ten municipalities who appeared before the Scopa gave Members of Parliament (MP’s) chilling accounts. The committee chairperson Themba Godi said district municipalities are not performing their duties and were there to assist small municipalities. “District municipalities are useless and should be scrapped, they’re in place to assist municipalities with financial reporting. Leaders in municipalities are unable to force people to pay for their electricity “shows gulf” between leaders and communities.” He said the amount the utility accumulate from interest makes it almost impossible for municipalities to settle their debt. The Scopa chairperson said he is meeting with the inter-ministerial committee today (Thursday) regarding the R13 billion owed to Eskom, adding that he believes both Scopa and the ministerial committee will come up with a way forward. Last month Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Minister Zweli Mkhize said local municipalities should act against those involved in flouting financial regulations and be able to discipline them whether they are employees of the municipality or elected councilors. Mkhize said this while speaking to news channel Afro Worldview a day after Auditor-General (AG), Kimi Makwetu released his audit report on municipalities which painted a bleak picture for local government. During the release of the municipal report, Makwetu revealed that the overall audit outcomes of the 257 municipalities in the country had regressed. -Afro Voice Reporter
