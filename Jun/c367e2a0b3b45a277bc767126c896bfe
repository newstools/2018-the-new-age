GAUTENG Premier David Makhura has officially placed the cash-strapped Emfuleni municipality under administration. “The leadership of the municipality under mayor Jacob Khawe has been working hard, together with the provincial government departments of Cogta and the treasury to address various institutional and financial issues,” Makura said yesterday, referring to interventions to turn the municipality around since November last year. He said despite the interventions the municipality’s finances deteriorated to a point where it was not able to guarantee the provision of minimum standards of services to communities. “Simply stated, what started as a financial problem has now become a problem of service delivery. This is a serious situation that warrants a more comprehensive intervention,” he said. He said the comprehensive intervention would ensure minimum standards of service delivery to communities and ensure financial viability through a financial recovery plan. “We will work with the leadership of the municipality to address service delivery minimum requirements and financial challenges over the next six months,” he said. The intervention will focus on service delivery including water, stormwater infrastructure, sanitation, energy and electricity, cleaning and waste management, roads, maintenance, resurfacing and fleet managements, infrastructure and human settlements. It will also enhancing revenue collection and engage with Rand Water and Eskom to negotiate debt repayment terms to ward off disruptions to water and electricity supplies to communities. The FF-Plus has welcomed the premier’s move, saying: “Emfuleni was already in a lot of trouble and things were getting out of hand. Emfuleni was unable to pay its outstanding debt of R419m to Rand Water and Eskom was also starting to show dismay at the nearly R170m outstanding for electricity.” -KUTULLO MADISHA|kutullom@afrotone.co.za
