THE Johannesburg metro police department’s (JMPD) K9 unit uncovered 554 Mandrax tablets and six bags of Mandrax powder at a drug house in Eldorado Park Extension 9 following a tip-off on Friday. The incident comes after the mayor of the city of Johannesburg, Herman Mashaba, together with member of the mayoral committee for health and social development Dr Mpho Phalatse and chief of the JMPD David Tembe joined hands to fight drugs. The city opened a substance abuse treatment centre at the Eldorado Park Clinic in Extension 9. Public safety MMC Michael Sun said the JMPD K9 officers received a call about a car previously hijacked in Tsakane being traced to the suspected house and after positively identifying the hijacked vehicle, officers searched the house and uncovered the illicit drugs. “We have been receiving multiple complaints about blatant drug dealing in Eldorado Park and our JMPD K9 unit has been monitoring the situation under cover. We knew it was just a matter of time before this drug bust. “We thank and urge the community to assist the JMPD with information on any criminal activities so we can bring these criminals down,” Sun said. During the official opening last week in Eldorado, Mashaba said the substance abuse centre must represent the start of a big fight against the evil of drugs. “We must build a zero tolerance culture against drugs dealers by continuing to encourage community members to come forward with information and a culture of accountability were corrupt officials must be dealt with,” he said. The centre is the second of the five that will be rolled out by the city in this financial year. Mashaba said the aim of the centre is to deal with the social factors that lead people to abuse substances. -SHONISANI TSHIKALANGE|shonisanit@afrotone.co.za
