GAUTENG police said they cannot confirm whether the four suspects arrested after hijacking Gauteng MEC for sports, arts, culture and recreation Faith Mazibuko are linked to the ones that allegedly hijacked Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga. The police said an intelligencedriven operation led to the arrest of four suspects and the recovery of the Mercedes-Benz ML 500 and a pistol that was taken from Mazibuko’s bodyguard Sgt Muvhali, yesterday morning. Muvhali was reportedly waiting for the MEC who was attending an ANC women’s function, outside the Reef Hotel at the corner of Albert and Loveday streets in Johannesburg, on Saturday. Three suspects approached Muvhali and threatened him with a firearm, ordered him to get out of the car and loaded him into the boot of the hijacked car. The suspects later dropped him at Bosmont, Joburg west. “Soon after the bodyguard was hijacked on Saturday, the crime intelligence and police trio task team were activated to track down the suspects and hijacked vehicle. “Within 48 hours the work of the team paid off when they arrested four suspects and recovered the hijacked vehicle,” Gauteng police spokesperson Capt Mavela Masondo said. “The suspects were arrested in Eldorado Park in the early hours of yesterday. They were found in possession of the hijacked vehicle, a firearm believed to be the one taken from Muvhali and another unlicensed firearm,” Masondo said. A week ago, Msimanga was hijacked in Midrand during the early hours of Saturday morning. The hijackers made off with his silver Mercedes-Benz CLS 250 and, according to the tracking device, the suspects drove to Pretoria North. “At this stage we cannot confirm if there is a link between the MEC’s and Msimanga’s cases. Police are investigating a number of hijacking cases.” He said the MEC’s suspects would appear in Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court in due course. ntombin@afrotone.co.za -NTOMBI NKOSI
