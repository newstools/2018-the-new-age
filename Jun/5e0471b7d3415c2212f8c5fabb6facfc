NUM Energy Sector coordinator Paris Mashego says the unions are prepared to negotiate on the 15% demand that they put forward if the employer is ready to meet them halfway. This comes as salary negotiations between Eskom management and worker unions are set to resume today following the intervention of Public Enterprise Minister Pravin Gordhan. Last week Gordhan announced that the 0% salary increase announced by Eskom CEO Phakamani Hadebe was off the table, setting the stage for a fresh new round of negotiations following the strike by workers affiliated to National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa(NUMSA) and National Union of Mineworkers(NUM). This was after Hadebe announced that the company would not be implementing any salary increase this year due to his financial position. Mashego said they received a mandate from members throughout the country which gave them a go ahead with the negotiations despite their lack of trust for the state power utility. “Depending on what the management is offering, we are prepared to make a significant move, however, it would have to be a double-digit figure because that is what our members are demanding,” He said as worker unions, they are aware of the company’s financial situation, and as a government institution, it has a duty to provide employment and creating more for the unemployed. “The biggest problems at Eskom were caused by management, even Hadebe said so. We understand that the company does not have the money but that is self-inflicted. There is more than R13 billion that is owed to the company, it must just find a way to collect that money” said Mashego. He said as a responsible union, they do not want to plunge the country into darkness, however, if the country continues to disrespect them like it has done with the 0% offer, our members will have no option but to do what we don’t support. -Afro Voice Reporter
