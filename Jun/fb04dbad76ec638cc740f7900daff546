The Randburg Magistrates Court has sentenced the man found guilty of killing popular Top Billing presenter Simba Mhere and his friend has been sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. Earlier this year, 27-year-old Preshalin Naidoo was found guilty of culpable homicide for causing a fatal crash that led to Mhere and his friend Kady-Shay O’Bryan’s death in Fourways, Johannesburg back in 2015. While delivering his sentence, Magistrate David Mhango said Naidoo embarked on a conduct of extreme proportions by driving at the speed of 166 Km/h when the crash occurred. “The families of the deceased have been traumatised‚” Mhango said. Mhango said the court had a duty to impose a sentence that would deter the accused and other drivers from driving recklessly on the road as road users were tired of reckless drivers. Naidoo will remain in custody pending the outcome of his leave to appeal the verdict. Mhere’s father Joseph was the only survivor of the accident that claimed his son and O’Bryan’s lives when they collided with a car on William Nicol Drive on their way to OR Tambo International Airport. -Afro Voice Reporter
