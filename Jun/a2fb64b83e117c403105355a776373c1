MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane says new signing Andile Jali will be an important factor in their quest for CAF Champions League glory. Sundowns completed the signing of Jali on a five-year deal on Friday following weeks of negotiations, beating out Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs for the midfielder’s signature. “He is stubborn and that’s what you need when you play in the Champions League,” Mosimane said. “Andile is good for us. International football is guaranteed for him. He’s a winner. He plays with Sibusiso Vilakazi, Percy Tau, Tiyani Mabunda for Bafana. They interact there. He will now be with (Oupa) Ace Manyisa.” Jali played with Manyisa at Pirates they formed a good partnership and will be looking to replicate that at Sundowns. “I didn’t come back to South Africa to relax and just say that I am done now because I am coming from Europe,” Jali said. “I have learned a lot of things from my time in Belgium, especially how you bounce back from losing a game. You mustn’t lose hope until the game is over.” -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@afrotone.co.za
