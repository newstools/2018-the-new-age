The corruption case against former acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane and his wife has on Thursday been withdrawn by the State in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria. Phahlane appeared to face charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering. The case was reportedly withdrawn after the state’s application for a further postponement in the matter was rejected. The State reportedly requested for a further three month postponement, in order to conduct further investigations. Phahlane initially appeared in court in February this year,  together with his wife Beauty Phahlane and co-accused car dealer Durand Snyman where they were each granted an R10 000 bail. Phahlane and his wife voluntarily presented themselves to the authorities in February. Phahlane was accused of receiving kickbacks in a form of vehicles from the car dealer in order to secure tenders for police suppliers. However, Phahlane claimed that the vehicles were sponsored. In December last year, a joint police operation between the Hawks and IPID raided a  number of his properties. It was reported then that seven of his properties were raided. However, Phahlane said that those reports were untrue, added he only owns one house. Previously IPID boss Robert Mcbride had voiced his conviction that Phahlane was indeed guilty of receiving kick-backs During a parliamentary meeting in May last year, McBride held firm that Phahlane had tried to obstruct investigations. Ipid chief investigator Matthew Sisoko supported his allegations. McBride also testified that General Phahlane had inquired from him years ago after the trade union Popcru had lodged a complaint against him what the investigation was all about. General Phahlane denied that he was leading an investigation into Ipid. -Afro Voice Reporter
