Cele’s assurance comes after he revealed that police managed to apprehend 13 suspects involved in cash-in-transit heist within a day. “South Africa is going to be safe, when you arrest 13 suspects within a day it means South Africa is getting better. all the units are on the streets, we will be reacting much quicker, and we will be reacting more decisively,” he said. Cele was briefing the media on the recent spate of cash-in-transit heists in Gauteng and nationally in Pretoria on Tuesday. He was joined by Fedusa media and research officer, Frank Nxumalo and South African Banking Risk Information Centre head of service delivery, Kevin Twiname. While addressing the media, Cele revealed that government had established the justice cluster with SAPS on the front lines where Justice Minister will look at the mechanism of affording suspect bails. He made an example of one suspect who had over 40 bails including murder. Among other stakeholders, the police are looking at working with the South African Development Countries (SADC) police in a bit to curb heists. “The head of police in Zimbabwe is a really good friend of mine. It looks like in SADC there is an increase in heists, we have one arrested suspect who is from Zimbabwe and one from Botswana,” Cele added.
