City of Johannesburg’s MMC for Public Safety Michael Sun has welcomed the appointment of 91 new firefighters by the city. Sun said the recruits are joining the department at the time when the city was heading towards a cold weather which is prone to higher fire-related incidents. According to Sun, the group, which consists of 79 men and 12 women have gone through an intensive three months of training and in-depth induction programme to acquaint themselves with relevant city policies and by-laws. “Always remember your calling and your training, serve and protect your residents with pride, take care of each other and never let anything break the bond between your brother and sister firefighters. “As the winter season approaches, we expect more fire incidents and you will face that call with professionalism and expediency,” Sun said. He said the firefighters will be deployed across all seven regions of the city after undergoing rigorous training at the City’s Emergency Management Services Academy. -Afro Voice Reporter
