FOLLOWING a public request for monetary donations of about R15000 by medical doctors and the CEO of Knobel Hospital in Moletji outside Polokwane to buy heaters and blankets for patients, health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba, who took exception to the move, visited the hospital on Monday. This after she issued a statement on Friday last week distancing the department from such a request for donations which she said was in violation of processes in the Treasury Regulations on Gifts and Sponsorships Section 78 of the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA). “As a department we have looked at the procurement plan of Knobel Hospital and it does not list heaters as part of their requirements. If the staff or management of the hospital had seen the need to have heaters, they should have followed the proper procurement process outlined in the PFMA to procure the items instead of utilising the name of the department to ask for donations which cannot be accounted for,” Ramathuba said. On Monday, after visiting the hospital to establish the veracity of the letter and understand the position of the hospital management on the contents thereof, Ramathuba slightly changed tune. “During the engagements, the doctors and hospital management told me that the letter was meant to galvanise resources from other doctors within the hospital and not to be published for public consumption,” the MEC said. “The doctors had their own small ‘Thuma mina’ initiative within the hospital.” Ramathuba then instructed the senior officials in the Capricorn district to assist the hospital to procure the muchneeded blankets and other supplies as well as ensuring that critical repairs were done at the hospital. She also reiterated the department’s commitment to refurbish and rehabilitate all ageing facilities as part of dealing with infrastructural challenges in the province’s healthcare facilities. -MONTSHO MATLALA|montshom@afrotone.co.za
