BAFANA Bafana coach Stuart Baxter has a dual purpose as he prepares his squad for their Cosafa Cup Plate final against Botswana tomorrow. Apart from gaining victory, Baxter said his main goals would be finding the right balance in his team but also giving all players a chance to turn out in the regional tournament. Following their 4-1 victory over Namibia in the Plate semifinal on Tuesday, Baxter said it was necessary to provide his young team the international experience they sorely needed to develop their skills. However, the Englishman will proceed with caution and won’t rotate the whole team. “We want everybody to play. We want the young ones to gain international experience, we certainly want to give them that,” Baxter said. “That’s why I put Lyle Foster in over the last 10-15 minutes against Namibia. I could have put in another player but he needs it. “Does that mean we will sell the game, not really. We want to win the the final match. “But you certainly want to make sure you stay true to yourself, because otherwise you will be bouncing back and forward. “So I will try hard but I don’t want to sacrifice the result.” Following their penalty shootout defeat to Madagascar in the quarterfinal on Sunday, Bafana bounced back to easily beat Namibia in the semifinal. Baxter identified the underlying issue that led to his team losing to Madagascar and being able to overturn that result against Namibia. “I don’t think it’s got anything to do with coaches playing safe. “Against Madagascar, we didn’t really have an orthodox right-back, we tried to play with Siyanda Xulu as a right-back and inverted him to allow Aubrey Modiba to go high,” Baxter said. -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@afrotone.co.za
