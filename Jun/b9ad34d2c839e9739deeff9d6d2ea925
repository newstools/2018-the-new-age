Sibanye-Stillwater mine says that it will take stern action against its managers who could be found to have forced miners to work in unsafe environments. The mine’s Head of Stakeholder engagement Thabisile Phumo says they have received information about intimidation of miners to go and work in unsafe places. “We can assure you, we will take stern action against anyone in our leadership levels who has been found to be forcing employees to go into unsafe environments. We have been going on a campaign to reinforce section 23 of the Act , which actually talks to the fact that employees have the right to pull out from unsafe workplaces,” she said to Power FM on Monday. This comes after an accident where five miners died at the Sibanye-Stillwater’s Kloof operations last week after allegedly entering an abandoned working area. It was alleged that the mine-workers were forced into the unsafe section of the shaft by their supervisor. Phumo said that the mine is still conducting investigations. However, she added that the mine was also encouraging miners to anonymously report to unions if they feel intimidated. She also called on employees who have proof of management forcing workers to go and work in unsafe areas to forward the information to the mine. “I’m calling out to those who have the information because the allegations have been going around in the media in the last week. Please make contact with us so that we can take action and make sure that we create an environment where employees can work without fear of intimidation,” she said. Meanwhile, the Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe said on Sunday that the Department was due to take action against Sibanye-Stillwater once a report compiled by the Acting Chief Inspector of Mines is completed. Out of 45 mining deaths accidents that happened this year, 20 have occurred at Sibanye-Stillwater mines alone. -Afro Voice Reporter
