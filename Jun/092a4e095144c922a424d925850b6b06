President Cyril Ramaphosa will, on Saturday, address the 42nd anniversary of the Youth Day Commemoration in Soweto, Johannesburg. The address will be under the theme “Live the Legacy: Towards a socio-economically empowered youth”. Every year the nation commemorates the 1976 student uprising to pay tribute to hundreds of youth who were brutally killed by the apartheid government for their position against the enforcement of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction in black schools. Ramaphosa said that the class of 1976 was at the forefront of the fight against apartheid and exposed the brutality of the apartheid regime to the world and ignited resistance around the country. “South Africa should use this day and Youth Month to give a special attention to the challenges facing young people and also to unlock opportunities for them to determine their destiny in honour of the youth of 1976.” He said that Forty-two years later, young people must help to keep their legacy alive by taking advantage of opportunities to build our country and change their lives. “Young people should join the ranks of active and responsible citizens by participating in democratic structures and processes like elections as well as be active leaders in the fight against crime, substance abuse, corruption and acts of violence.” Ramaphosa added that despite the significant improvement made since 1994, a lot still needs to be done to better the living conditions of young people, particularly black youth. He has also called on youth and all South Africans to use the Youth Month to honour the sacrifices made by Tata Madiba and Mama Sisulu towards a free, democratic, non-sexist and non-racial South Africa. -Afro Voice Reporter
