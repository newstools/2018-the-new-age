Limpopo police and Marble Hall outside Groblersdal have launched a manhunt for suspects who hijacked motorists and killed occupants in two different cases over the weekend. A teacher from Mbangezika High School in Shikukwane Village was found dead in the bushes and school examination papers lying around next to his body. According to provincial police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe, preliminary investigations at the scene found an empty cartridge next to the deceased’s body and his car missing. “The motive for this crime is still not clear at this stage but carjacking cannot be ruled out,” Ngoepe said. In Marble Hall, police have launched a manhunt after a middle-aged man was fatally shot and three others sustained gunshot wounds at Toiskraal village during an alleged robbery. Ngoepe said the police were alerted after community members discovered the people lying down with multiple gunshot wounds, with one person already dead. “The motive behind this incident is still unknown but robbery cannot be ruled out,” he said. Ngoepe said investigations on both cases were ongoing the police have currently not identified suspects.
