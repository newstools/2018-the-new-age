A GROUP of black postgraduate medical students are expected to meet with the University of the Free State’s dean of the medical faculty today over racism allegations. Boitumelo Kgomo, a UFS graduate in psychology from the EFF Labour Desk in Johannesburg, said this had been happening for quite some time. She alleges that black postgrad students are not treated the same as the white students. “On the top of our list of grievances is racism, because one of the professors told one post-grad student that the “K” word was not offensive and victimisation of black students. Constructive dismissals from the postgrad programme such as clinical pathology and refusal to credit passed modules from other universities, whereas UFS failed to support them while studying at UFS, failure to support students academically at the medical microbiology department and failure to involve and listen to students are also on the list,” Kgomo said. She said black students were not even given a scope when approaching exams unlike white students, who were even given time should they not understand something academically. UFS spokesperson Lacea Loader said the executive management of the university was aware of the appointment a group of undergraduate students had with the head of the school of clinical medicine, Prof Nathaniel Mofolo. “An agenda was requested from the students but it has not yet been received. The UFS can only respond once the meeting has taken place,” Lacea said. BECKER SEMELA beckers@afrotone.co.za
