Spain’s Supreme Court on Tuesday cut a more-than-six-year jail sentence for the King’s brother-in-law to five years and 10 months for charges including tax fraud and embezzlement after an appeal, the court said. Inaki Urdangarin was found guilty and sentenced to six years and three months in February last year for using royal connections to overcharge regional governments through public contracts to stage sports and tourist events and with tax fraud. Urdangarin lives with Princess Cristina and their four children in Switzerland. The original ruling by a provincial Mallorcan court came after a six-year investigation and amid a slew of corruption cases against politicians and public figures. One such case ended in May with the jailing of dozens of high-ranking People’s Party (PP) politicians and a vote of no-confidence against the party’s leader and then-Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. Rajoy lost the no-confidence motion and was ousted to be replaced by Socialist Pedro Sanchez. Under Spanish law, Urdangarin can appeal the sentence in the Constitutional Court. -Reuters
