Police Minister Bheki Cele said further investigations will be conducted into the murder case of slain former Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa. Cele said he has received a report into the murder case, which he is not satisfied with. “I did say I am putting my head on the block. The Senzo Meyiwa thing is going to be pushed, and it’s going to be pushed very hard. I received the report that I’m completely unsatisfied with, I think about two-three days back.” The minister said that he will be meeting the team that is working on the case. Meanwhile, Cele is also on Monday expected to announce plans to address aggravated robberies that have been on the increase in the recent months. He said that the cash-in-transit heists were ‘terrorism’ when the criminals begin to kill innocent people. “The police dropped the ball when it comes to structures that were dealing with cash-in-transit-heists. I don’t know why we take away our highly trained specialised units out of the roads. I don’t know why we would not equip them with high powered performing cars out there.” The police ministry recently pronounced the top priority crimes, cash-in-transit-heists, gangsterism, political killings and taxi violence as the crimes that need serious attention. “One thing that we want to do, we want to take the top management out of their offices and put them on the streets. There are too many of those officers that are in their offices and not working on the ground,” Cele told SABC. -Afro Voice Reporter
