The Director for the Department of Public Administration Collective Bargaining Modise Letsatsi says the Public Servants Association (PSA) has jumped the gun by opting to serve notice of its intended strike. Modise says the union’s action could lead to their strike being unprotected. “There is an internal process that we must exhaust within the bargaining council before embarking on a strike. We are saying people must not embark on an illegal strike,” he said. Modise further said the PSA declared dispute on April 24, adding that they insisted on participating in negotiation processes. The Director of Public Administration Collective Bargaining further said there was no rule that barred members from participating in negotiation because they have declared a dispute. “The rules of the council do not say explicit, that once you declared dispute you can’t be part of the negotiations but they were not negotiating in good faith,” Modise said. Meanwhile, Minister for Public Service and Administration Ayanda Dlodlo on Wednesday condemned the decision by PSA on its intentions to embark on a strike next week. “We are concerned that the planned strike action is procedural as it is in complete violation of prescribed processes.” The in-principle agreement, according to the regulations of the PSCBC, will be on the table for a period of 21 days, in which time labour unions can make a final consultation for a mandate to sign. “This period of consultation is still unfolding and as such, we are in a protected phase until the 19th of June 2018,” Dlodlo said. -Afro Voice Reporter
