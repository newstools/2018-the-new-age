Some of the shine has gone out of the Comrades Marathon following the withdrawal of defending champion Camille Herron yesterday. With just eight days to go before the iconic race gets underway, Herron, who won the up run last year, withdrew from this year’s race due to injury. The American long-distance runner stunned the field last year, winning in only her second attempt at the ultra marathon. She crossed the line in 6 hours 36 minutes and was one of the favourites to win this year’s down run as well. “Her training and racing schedule has been severe and I did advise her to slow down and rather just concentrate on the Comrades Marathon earlier this year,” Nick Bester, national manager of the Nedbank Running Club, said. “She could have become the first female since Elena Nurgalieva to win back-to-back races.” Herron stunned the running community last night with the news of her withdrawal. “With much sadness and a broken heart I’m withdrawing from Comrades. I had a sudden quad strain last week,” Herron said. “I’m back running and while I remain hopeful and optimistic, I’m trying to respect my body and do what’s right. “I have a great medical team here and we feel confident we can make progress to ensure I toe the line at Western States. I appreciate everyone’s support, compassion and good karma right now. “I’m still just as much a fan and will be in spirit with my Nedbank Running Club teammates and everyone racing the Comrades this year. “Bless you all, enjoy the magic of Comrades and Asijiki!” Her withdrawal is obviously a blow for the Nedbank Running Club and will dilute the Elite women’s field but with other race favourites such as Gerda Steyn and Charné Bosman, the club is still confident that the women’s winner will come from within its ranks. –AfroVoice Reporter
