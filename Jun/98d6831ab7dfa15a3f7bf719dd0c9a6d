PUPILS in Bramble Way, Bonteheuwel, in Cape Town, had a rude awakening yesterday morning when they walked past the body of an alleged gangster who had been shot and killed in an apparent hit. The 21-year-old victim was shot in the left side of his head. Social media users yesterday claimed that the victim was a hitman for the Americans gang and was killed in the recent wave of skirmishes for turf supremacy in the gang-infested area. The killing happened about 7.25am in Bramble Way near Bramble Primary School, sending panic-stricken pupils and parents scampering for safety. Residents kept their children in their homes fearing revenge attacks and that their kids might be hit by stray bullets. Police spokesperson Capt FC van Wyk confirmed the incident and said the 21-year-old man was found dead on the corners of Bracken Road and Bramble Way. The police have opened a case of murder for investigation and the circumstances surrounding the death were under investigation. Meanwhile, one of the residents said on social media that the saddest part of it all was that these killers were known to many members of the communities they operated in. “Many parents are sitting with confessions on their conscience from these killings and would rather take them to their graves instead of giving up their sons and daughters to the police.” -VINCENT CRUYWAGEN|vincentc@afrotone.co.za
