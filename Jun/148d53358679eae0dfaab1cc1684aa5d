A toxicology report has on Wednesday confirmed that three-year-old Courtney Pieters was given a very high dosage of poison in the water given to her and which ultimately led to her death two years ago. This was revealed in the Western Cape High Court when the states forensic pathologist explained tests conducted on the decomposed body of the little girl to determine the exact cause of her death. 40-year-old Mortimer Saunders stands accused of raping and killing Pieters. Her body was discovered in a shallow grave in the Epping Industrial centre on the weekend following her disappearance. Saunders was renting at the family’s home when the incident happened. According to state pathologist the effects of the ant poison which Pieters could have experienced after being forced to drink the poison include diarrhea, urination, chest constricting, build up of fluid in the lungs, lack of enough oxygen to the heart (cardiac arrest), slurred speech, convulsions and one can eventually go into a coma (leading to death). “The poison took half an hour to get to its peak concentration but after 20 minutes some of the effects started to kick in,” the pathologist confirmed. It was also confirmed that children are more vulnerable to pesticide poisoning and they need to receive immediate medical attention. Last year Pieters’ death sparked an uproar and drew a lot of attention to violence against children and gender-based violence. Former President Jacob Zuma paid the Pieters family a visit after the incident where he promised to prioritise the case. -Afro Voice Reporter
