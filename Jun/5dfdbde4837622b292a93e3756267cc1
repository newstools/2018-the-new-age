Bafana Bafana have failed to reach the semi-finals of the COSAFA Cup following their 4-3 defeat in a penalty shoot-out  to Madagascar on Sunday afternoon at the Peter Mokaba Stadium. Bafana created a couple of chances but were let down by their finishing. Stuart Baxter’s side could have taken the lead in the 5th minute when  Luther Singh played a short free-kick to Lebohang Maboe inside the box, but Maboe hit the ball wide. Bafana got a clear chance in the 20th minute when Singh found himself in a one on one situation with the goalkeeper but failed to beat the keeper. Madagascar nearly broke the deadlock in the 33rd minute when Jaotombo Bourah’s long range shot was saved by Reyaad Pieterse. Bafana came back from the halftime break showing some signs of getting an early goal. In the 63rd minute, Aubrey Modiba almost gave Bafana the lead but he was denied the goal when his shot hit the crossbar. Neither side could find the winning goal in regular time and the game was decided on penalties which Madagascar won 4-3. -Afro Reporter
