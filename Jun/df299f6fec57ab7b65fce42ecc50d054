THE Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) has established the 5G Forum with Working Groups – aimed at addressing a number of aspects in relation to 5G. These aspects include “spectrum” to enable the uptake of 5G systems, policy and regulation, standards, research and development, as well as use cases. Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane says that it’s in the best interests of South Africa’s digital future and in accordance with South AfricaConnect to increase broadband access and usage. “The Electronic Communications Act encourages research on topics designed to achieve the objects of the act as well as with the mandate to ensure efficient use of spectrum,” the minister said. She was addressing the fifth 5G Huddle conference in Durban recently. “One of the key strategies geared at achieving the digital agenda in South Africa is to ensure that the policies and regulatory regimes for International Mobile Telecommunications 2020 (IMT 2020) – also known as 5G – are flexible, and that they support innovative technologies as well as serve the needs of end users,” the minister said. 5G is the future of emerging networks and infrastructure that is to support the digitisation of the economy and societal activities worldwide. “To this end, Icasa has prioritised the diffusion of technologies as one of its strategic objectives in establishing innovative approaches to the use of emerging technologies in order to advance efficient use of the spectrum resource.” She said the affordability of technology for the people of South Africa and Africa remains a concern. “Otherwise, if the issue of cost, in whichever way we look at it, is not grappled with and resolved, integration into the next generation of technology will remain a serious impediment towards improving of the digital divide,” the minister said.
