The ANC has called on its provincial leadership in the Free State to institute disciplinary proceedings against the mayor of Dihlabeng Local Municipality, Lindiwe Makhalema for calling President Cyril Ramaphosa a sellout. In a strongly worded statement issued by the party spokesperson Pule Mabe, the party has called on its Free State leadership to urgently undertake disciplinary proceedings against what it calls “instigators of disunity within the organisation”, Mabe was reacting to a report in the Citizen newspaper which alleges that Makhalema refered to Ramaphosa as a sellout on a facebook group called Loyal ANC Members, which prides itself on having 80 000 verified ANC members. In a screenshot posted on the story, Makhalema refused to apologise and to retract her utterances when some members of the group pleaded with her to do so given her position. Mabe said as the ANC, they condemned in the strongest terms the insults directed at Ramaphosa by the party leaders and any other party member on Social Media. “The ANC NEC recently adopted a social media policy that moves from a premise that all ANC structures and members will operate within the discipline and policies of the organisation whilst still expressly enjoying the freedom of expression. “The ANC believes that it is possible to express viewpoints without resorting to personal attacks and insults,” Mabe said. According to Mabe, the ANC’s Social Media policy (Rule36) implicitly prescribes that any social media posting must be legal, ethical and respectful at all times while (Rule 40) prohibits members from utilising inflammatory language. “We, therefore, find the recent upsurge in insults towards our leadership, particularly the President, extremely disturbing and view them in a serious light. “The use of social media platforms should at all times be in line with the ANC Constitution and Code of Conduct and seek to advance debates and discussions in a rational and responsible manner,” he said. Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela also condemned Makhalema’s post, saying it amounted to defamation of character -Afro Voice Reporter
