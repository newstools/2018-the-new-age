The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) says that the agency is investigating about 300 000 grant beneficiaries that are fraudulently on the grant database. Sassa spokesperson Kgomotso Diseko says that the agency began with preliminary investigations after its system detected some suspicious payments that were meant to be facilitated last month. “At the end of May, our Internal Control System reflected some suspicious payments. We then consulted the South African Reserve Bank to assist us to recall those payments, that were successfully done. At the moment we have launched a very wide investigation so that we understand the circumstances,” Diseko told Power FM. Diseko said that the Agency intends to take drastic steps against officials who will be found guilty of having fraudulently facilitated the names into the system. He added that the criminals who were fraudulently entering names on to the system were now using a new modus operandi where “they use Sassa staff to manipulate the system and inflate individual grants”. The investigations found that officials fraudulently inflated grants that were already on the system. Diseko clarified that these were not new beneficiaries but names that were genuinely on the system but had their original grants manipulated. However, the agency managed to stop those payments that were meant to be processed. Afro Voice Reporter
