Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has apologised to the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services for sending a letter very late informing it that she would not be attending a scheduled meeting. The apology comes after the Public Protector last week missed a meeting with the committee because of a family-related emergency. MP’s were also left frustrated after Mkhwebane’s Deputy Kevin Malunga also did not show up for the meeting. On Wednesday Mkhwebane told the committee that could not send her deputy because she believed that the matters to be discussed required her ‘special attention’. ” I have written a letter dated 18 May 2018 to the Committee explaining why I have not been able to delegate the Deputy Public Protector,” she said. According to Mkhwebane, following her letter to Committee Chairperson Mathole Motshekga, it is now up to Malunga to decide whether he wants to make the reasons public. Irate MP’s have demanded that Motshekga make the letter the Public Protector sent, available to them. ” I am not convinced that the PP is showing remorse for her absence at last week’s meeting because the reason was never provided to us – perhaps the letter must be shared with us. Those who were present at last week’s no-show meeting felt very much disrespected,” said ANC MP Madipoane Mothapo. Motshekga said Committee members across the board felt disrespected by the Public Protector last week when they received her letter at the last minute informing the committee that she could not attend. “You cancelled At the last minute last week and didn’t send your deputy and we were not happy and we would like you to take us into your confidence please,” Motshekga said. Mkhwebane was invited to brief the committee on the Rules and Policy on the appointment of special advisors, and DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen’s request for the committee to hold an enquiry into her fitness to hold office. -Afro Voice Reporter
