FOLLOWING the arrival of Ben Motswari and Asavela Mbekile at Orlando Pirates, competition for slots in the middle of the park promises to be tough in the new season. The previous campaign saw coach Milutin Sredojevic play Musa Nyatama as a holding midfielder, a position he excelled in, with Xola Mlambo playing alongside him as an attacking midfielder. That worked well, with both combining efficiently to see Pirates finish the season second on the log. However, management wants to further strengthen that department and have brought Motswari from Wits and Mbekile from Mamelodi Sundowns, both on free deals. Motswari is likely to compete with Mlambo for the attacking role but it remains to be seen how Sredojevic will change his format or stick to the same starting 11. Motswari is a box-to-box player and can also score goals if provided with good ball. Together with Nyatama, they will be expected to produce results. Mbekile, who found it difficult to play at Sundowns in the past two seasons, will also be looking to cement his place. He can play as a defensive midfielder or right back. At Sundowns he played as a right back as there was no space for him in the central midfield. But Pirates didnâ€™t have someone like him last season who can be a destroyer in the middle of the park and they will have an option to play him there and push up Nyatama, Mlambo or Motswari. There will also some tough competition on the wings following the arrival of Vincent Pule from Wits. He will be competing with Luvuyo Memela, Thembikosi Lorch and Thabo Qalinge. This also means that players such as Thabo Matlaba, Mpho Makola and Issa Sarr might be offloaded. Bucs are also believed to be on the verge of releasing Bernard Morrison and either Jackson Mabokgwane or Wayne Sandilands, following the arrival of goalie Brilliant Khuzwayo. -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@afrotone.co.za
