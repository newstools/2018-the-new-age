Former SABC Chief Operations Officer(COO) Hlaudi Motsoeneng is expected to come under intense questioning when he is cross-examined on utterances he made while giving evidence at the CCMA on Wednesday. Motswoeneng told the CCMA on Wednesday, where he is challenging what he calls an “unfair dismissal from the public broadcaster” about some of the reasons that led to him taking decisions at the public broadcaster. These include the controversial 80/20 and 90/10 policy, which advocated for more locally produced content on ABC platforms, both on radio and TV, which some said were not financially viable for the broadcaster. He accused the SABC of rushing to fill his post after his dismissal while processes were still underway to review the decision. Motsoeneng is demanding to be reinstated as Head of Group Corporate Affairs at the SABC. He denied the accusation that some of the decisions he took have cost the public broadcaster R300 million, saying he has assisted the broadcaster to face some of its funding challenges, and saying that workers at the broadcaster missed him. This was after SABC Board member Krish Naidoo, who also served in the  board during Motsoeneng’s tenure at the SABC told the CCMA that the quotas adopted by Motsoeneng have cost the public broadcaster revenue in excess of R300 million He also told the commission that he was considering suing Motsoeneng after he called him a sell-out at a public gathering which he addressed. -Afro Voice Reporter
