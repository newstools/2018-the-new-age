Madagascar’s president named a new cabinet and pledged free elections late on Monday, following a court order to form a consensus government in an effort to end a long-running political crisis. The cabinet includes allies to the three most powerful politicians on the Indian Ocean island: President Hery Rajaonarimampianina and two of his predecessors: Andry Rajoelina, who seized power in a coup in 2009, and the man he ousted, Marc Ravalomanana. The three men – popularly known by locals as the DJ, the milkman, and the accountant in reference to their previous jobs – control three separate and often deeply divided political factions. “The intent of this government is to organise an inclusive presidential election whose results have to be accepted by all,” Rajaonarimampianina said in a televised speech. Rajaonarimampianina did not say when the election would take place. He appointed local International Labour Organisation representative Christian Ntsay as prime minister last week. -Reuters
