RIA Ledwaba was named the first woman vice-president of the South African Football Association (Safa) at a national council meeting in Polokwane yesterday. The three new Safa vice-presidents were chosen at the meeting of council just prior to Bafana Bafana v Madagascar Cosafa Cup match at Peter Mokaba stadium. Ledwaba got the most votes, 28 out of 29. The other two vice-presidents are Xolile Nkompela who got 27 votes and Gay Mokoena with 16. While Nkompela retained his position, Ledwaba and Mokoena are new to their positions replacing Lucas Nhlapo and Elvis Shisana. Irvin Khoza is one of the vice-presidents by virtue of being the chairperson of the Premier Soccer League. Safa president Danny Jordaan said they were pleased as on association to have the first woman vice-president in the history of South African football. “I think it is a wonderful day for South African football, first of all, we welcome four women at the national executive or council,” Jordaan said. “The support has just been overwhelming for woman, she has the highest number of votes in the congress and again today, she got the most number of votes.” -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@afrotone.co.za
