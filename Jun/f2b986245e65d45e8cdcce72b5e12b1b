The Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) will on Thursday grant mining permits to a group of people in Kimberley who have been illegally mining diamond in the area. According to Deputy Minister Godfrey Oliphant, this forms part of a plan to formalise the trade. The illegal miners known as ‘Zama Zamas’ have been illegally mining in the area for about five years without being formalised. The Department will hand over two mining permits to the miners who will now take care of the artisanal diamond mining operations. “This is a major milestone for both the mining group and the miners who for a long time have been seen as illegal miners,” Oliphant said. The Black First Land First (BLF) described this development as a victory for the Zama Zamas in Kimberley who have been involved in a long struggle for the right to mine legally. The process has allegedly also been given a blessing by former Minister of Mineral Resources, Mosebenzi Zwane. “BLF calls on the current Minister of Mineral Resources, Gwede Mantashe, to make sure the Mining Charter prioritises Zama Zamas. The Mining Charter must treat them as legitimate landowners and therefore, priority miners. BLF is encouraged by the handing over of permits but calls for a comprehensive process to ensure mine workers and Zama Zamas are brought into the economic mainstream,” BLF said in a statement. -Afro Voice Reporter
