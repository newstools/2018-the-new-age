THE late local reggae star and music legend Lucky Dube’s daughter, Nkulee Dube, was honoured by mayor of New York Byron Brown with the keys to the city of Buffalo in New York. The 32-­year-­old singer received the ultimate distinction of having the city of Buffalo and mayor Brown issue a proclamation naming the day as Nkulee Dube Day. She was bestowed this honour on Monday in the presence of the New York senate and senator Tim Kennedy who celebrated her for her exemplary service and was welcomed into the city by the state of New York legislator of Erie county Barbara Miller-Williams. “No female artist has managed to fuse Afro­soul and jazz with reggae music in one song and this 32­year­old singer, songwriter Nkulee Dube has done so much in such a short space of time since entering this challenging yet exciting industry. Other artists have not gained such attention and recognition with these multiple proclamations before. Nkulee richly deserves this and more on the journey forward,” the mayor’s proclamation accepting the touring reggae singer into the city of Buffalo said.
