The reigning Miss KZN, Bongeka Kweyama, who was crowned in April this year in Ballito has major plans to uplift the province’s youth and to aid the vulnerable as she settles in her
position. The 27-year-old former Pinetown Girls’ High School pupil says the youth, more especially young girls, will be her major focus as she starts her year-long mission as the province’s beauty queen. She said this is because she is aware of the daily challenges they face while trying to achieve their goals in the male-dominated and brutal world. Speaking to Afro Voice about her plans, Kweyama says when her reign comes to an end in April next year she wants to be remembered as the beauty queen who contributed a lot to uplift youth and those in need. Kweyama says she is busy with collecting donations which includes food and warm clothes to be donated to orphanages and old age homes. She says the stuff will be sent to the Role Models Foundation, an entity that will distribute it
to country’s 264 charities. Kweyama, a beauty with brains as she holds a bachelors degree in geography and environment management from the University of KwaZulu-Natal and honours from Unisa, is not new to modeling and beauty pageants. sihlem@afrotone.co.za
