MEMBERS of the Public Servants Association will today embark on a full blown strike at the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa). Deputy PSA general manager Tahir Maepa confirmed that all members at Sassa workplaces would down tools. He said the Department of Social Development said it would implement the public servants salary agreement that was signed a fortnight ago but Sassa did not belong to the Public Service Coordinating Bargaining Council (PSCBC) as it was an entity of the government. “The strike continues because there is nothing on the table. The only thing we saw was the circular put out by the Department of Social Development concerning the agreement reached between other unions and the PSCBC. “For us if they will be implementing the public service agreement of 7% this is a good thing because it gives us a head start and we can then aim at improving on that. “But as things stand now there is no offer that has come to the table so the strike continues and members will down tools,” he said. Maepa said even if there was an offer on the table they would still go ahead. “Next week there will be further discussions with the minister (Susan Shabangu), at the end of the day we all want to find an amicable solution. “If they do not come back to us we will continue with the strike until they meet our demands,” he said. Maepa said the members will protest at their workplaces for the duration of the strike. Sassa spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi said they were not aware that PSA members were going to down tools today. The union has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to put the entity under administration as “there is a lot of corruption and mismanagement of funds”. There was a lack of leadership within Sassa and a collapse of the entity, the letter to Ramaphosa said. Maepa said the only way to clean up Sassa was putting it under administration. -TIISETSO MANOKO|tiisetsom@afrotone.co.za
