Energy Minister Jeff Radebe said South Africa’s grid infrastructure requires further strengthening. “The department is implementing non-grid solutions such as solar, especially for rural areas and informal settlements. In order to advance to the economic transformation, we need to give effect to the national development plan.” Radebe was addressing the energy dialogue in Gallagher Estate, Midrand on Friday. The month of May marks the celebration of energy whereby the department takes the opportunity to make South Africans conscious and aware of the issues of Energy Efficiency in their daily lives. At the same time, the minister said his department will drive initiatives to ignite women and youth empowerment as energy is the engine for economic development. “Without energy, there is no economic growth, the department will ensure that women benefit in the energy sector as investors. The unemployment rate is now considered to be alarming.” He said the stats show that 48% of the youth were unemployed in the third quarter of 2016. Radebe added that he hopes the dialogues will be the beginning of a long relationship in entrenching youth in the energy sector. -Afro Voice Reporter
