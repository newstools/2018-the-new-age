THE official launch of the 2018 Prestige Agri Awards will mark the recognition of people who have ploughed so much into ensuring food security. Western Cape MEC for economic opportunities Alan Winde said this was the seventh year that the department of agriculture had collaborated with a supermarket store to sponsor
the awards. The competition endeavours to celebrate excellence among those working in the province’s agricultural industry, across 11 categories and in 16 districts. The awards originated in 2002 by the Hex River Valley Association and have passed all expectations. More than 10000 people have since participated. Winde said: “The awards are a recognition for people who put so much of their energy into ensuring that there is food security that there is foreign exchange coming into the country from exports and that they can provide for their families.” Winde said an independent study into the impact of the awards conducted in 2015 revealed that they inspired pride in agricultural workers, encouraged them to acquire or learn new skills and created positive perceptions about agricultural work. Last year’s winner, Hermanus Bienas from Vredendal, travelled to Germany as part of his prize where he was exposed to agricultural and supermarket fresh produce practices in the country. On the menu for this year’s winner of the regional awards will be a cash prize, a certificate and trophy and supermarket vouchers. The cherry on the cake is the provincial awards in November, where the overall Agri-Worker of the year will be selected. The overall winners will get an R25000 cash prize, an overseas trip valued at R60000, iPad, vouchers, data and a place on the Prestige Agri-worker board which meets with Winde quarterly to discuss issues in the sector.
