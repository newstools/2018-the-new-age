Black First Land First (BLF) leader Andile Mngxitama has called on South Africans to come in their numbers to support former President Jacob Zuma when he appears at the Durban High Court on Friday. Zuma is facing 16 charges related to corruption, money laundering, racketeering and fraud. “Black First Land First say hands off zuma, arrest de Klerk. The focus must be on real criminals. “President Zuma is the message we must send out to our people that he is being persecuted because of his programme of radical economic transformation which has been rejected by the current leader of the ANC,” Mngxitama said. “For BLF, President Jacob Zuma remains president. We are not going to allow 400 people in Parliament to determine our fate. Our people voted for President Zuma. He is still president as far as concern.” Mngxitama took a swipe at the South African Communist Party (SACP) for being used as a tool of white monopoly capital. “Blade Nzimande today has forgotten communism. He as fortogettn socialism. The Communist party has been reduced into a tool of white monopoly capital. “That is why the agenda is against president Zuma because he is our intellectual leader for radical economic transformation. One of the bulldogs of white monopoly capital is a communist party led by Nzimande,” he said.   -Afro Voice Reporter
