SARS acting commissioner Mark Kingon said yesterday the agency would shorten the “tax season” by three weeks to improve efficiencies. This will be the first time SARS has shortened the season, which will run from July 1 to August 31. Kingon said a shorter filing season would allow additional time for SARS, taxpayers and the tax fraternity to deal with return verifications before the December holiday break. “Often there are delays with taxpayers having to respond to our queries and requests over the holiday break. The quiet period after the first three months of the tax season has now been removed, resulting in efficient use of our resources. We’ve been hard at work taking
stock of how we can be more efficient and improve service to taxpayers.” The agency has been criticised for delays in tax refunds with Tax Ombud judge Bernard Ngoepe saying many complaints were justified. Kingon said the main objective is to make tax compliance a simple and routine experience for the taxpayer. “This is a work in progress, and we will be refining our initiatives with every tax season,” he said. SARS said returns for the current year of assessment will take priority over outstanding returns. -BERNARD SATHEKGE
