Murder accused Thabani Mzolo has abandoned his bid for a bail application. Mzolo briefly appeared at the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday morning for the murder of his former girlfriend 21-year old Mangosuthu University of Technology student Zolile Khumalo where he announced through his lawyer that he was abandoning his bid. He will remain in custody at the Westville Correctional Centre until his next court appearance on 29 August. Mzolo faces charges of murder for allegedly fatally shooting Khumalo at her university residence room in April after Khumalo allegedly ended their relationship two weeks prior to her death. Speaking outside the court, Khumalo’s father Comfort said he would like to see a life imprisonment being implemented on the accused, even though this won’t bring back her daughter. “My heart breaks every time I look at him and think that here is the person who took my child’s life,” he said. #ZolileKhumalo father Comfort Khumalo says he will be happy with the accused being handed life sentence eve if it won’t bring his daughter back. @AfroVoiceLIVE @afroworldview pic.twitter.com/RLBwjTqFEu — Sibongiseni Maphumulo (@SiboMaphumulo) June 19, 2018 During his earlier appearance, the court heard that Mzolo shot Khumalo twice and then kicked her body which was laying on the floor. -Afro Voice Reporter
