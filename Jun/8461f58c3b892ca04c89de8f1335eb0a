THE price of petrol set to hit new records high of R16 litre next month on the back of a weak rand. According to unaudited mid-month fuel data released by the Central Energy Fund (CEF), the latest data forecast a rise of around 32 cents a litre for petrol, 30 cents for diesel and 22 cents for illuminating paraffin. The price of a litre of petrol is at a high of R15.79/l for 95 octane and R15.54/l for 93 octane. If petrol goes up by 32c/l, that means motorists will pay R16.11/l for 95 octane and R15.86/l for 93 octane. Analysts said that with the rand weakening further, sooner or later motorists must tighten their belts and prepare for a “nightmare” record high of R20/l if the local currency continues to bleed. The Automobile Association (AA) said since the start of June, the rand had steadily weakened against the US dollar, with the average cost per dollar having climbed from around the R12.50/$ mark to nearly R13.00/$. Fortunately international oil prices retreated over the same period and have had a very small impact on the figures. “Almost all of the increase is due to rand weakness and the picture would have looked very much worse if international oil prices had not come down over the past two weeks,” the AA said. “With the volatility of oil markets over the past six weeks, an increase in the oil price cannot be ruled out in the short to medium term and we once again advise all motorists to avoid unnecessary journeys, make use of car pooling and practise economical driving techniques.” Analysts projected the weakness of the rand to reach a range of R14.50/$ and said that although the currency weakened had much, it is far better when compared to other emerging markets currencies. The rand is one of the worst performing currencies, as its peers raised interest rates and concerns around South Africa’s account deficit grows. The rand was weaker on Friday as Eskom began to cut electricity and was trading at R13.44/$. -BERNARD SATHEKGE|bernards@afrotone.co.za
