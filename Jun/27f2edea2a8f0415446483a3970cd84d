Lobby group AfriForum says that it is considering taking legal action against government’s move towards expropriation of land without compensation. AfriForum says that it has already written to parliament to inform it of its intentions. “The civil rights watchdog AfriForum has notified Parliament in writing that the organisation will consult its legal team regarding the option to declare the process which entails that Section 25 of the Constitution be amended to empower the state to expropriate property without compensation as illegal,” said AfriForum in a statement. Following the EFF’s motion for the expropriation of land without compensation which was supported by the ruling party, government has vowed to accelerate land reform. Parliament’s Constitutional Review Committee has been initiated to go on a tour to get public input on the matter. The Review Committee has also extended its deadline for the public submissions on the review of section 25 of the constitution. The new closing date is now June 15. However, AfriForum deputy CEO Ernst Roets says that they don’t believe that these public consultations process will be effective. “We don’t believe that there will be an efficient consultation with the public, and we believe that the consultations that has been organised is flawed procedurally for a variety of reasons,” Roets told news channel, Afro WorldView. The Committee will embark on a tour from June 26. The lobby group claims that very little marketing has been done to inform the public of these public hearings, “even though very little time is left between the drafting of this letter and the first public hearing, which is scheduled to take place on 26 June 2018. “Major Metropolitans are excluded from the process in which no public hearings would take place,” said AfriForum. -Afro Voice Reporter
