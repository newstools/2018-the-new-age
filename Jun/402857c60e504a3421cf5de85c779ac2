Afro pop duo Mafikizolo came to Gugu Khathi’s defence after she was lambasted by Twitter for her questionable attitude at the South African Music Awards (Samas) at the weekend. Khathi who is married to big shot music man, DJ Tira rubbed people the wrong way when she walked on stage to accept an award on behalf of the group and seemed to diss the show with body language that said she’d rather be somewhere else. In a now deleted video posted on Instagram, Nhlanhla Nciza and Theo Kgosinkwe thanked South Africans for their award and addressed their dissatisfaction with Khathi. “When we found out we had won, we asked Gugu to collect the award on our behalf and she was nervous about going on stage,” Nciza said in a video posted on social media. “People don’t know Gugu so they don’t understand the way she speaks, even when we’re chilling and talking and having fun she would make those kinds of facial expressions but because we know that we don’t take offence,” she said. Defending her attitude, Khathi’s husband also took the opportunity to let his fans know that his wife’s actions were in no way a reflection of who she is. “She didn’t like the “rest in peace Mabala Entertainment” joke. She is a great person who doesn’t appreciate negative vibes. Must we be laughing at Mabala now that they not focusing on music?” Tira wrote on Twitter. The artist’s explanation seemed to fall on deaf ears as social media users continued to express their anger and asked the DJ to leave her at home next time. –Nontokozo Gxumisa
