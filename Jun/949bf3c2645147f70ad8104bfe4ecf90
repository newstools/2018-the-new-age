THE acrimonious standoff between Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille and the DA, which has affected her performance, will come before a full bench of the Cape Town High Court today and tomorrow. The matter was postponed in May because the judges wanted more time to study the documentation. But they reinstated De Lille as mayor after the DA federal executive had resolved to endorse a Cape Town metro caucus decision to fire her. An optimistic De Lille said yesterday: “I’ve always respected the judiciary. This is my opportunity to tell my side of the story. I have faith in the courts.” The court will likely bring an end to a scorched earth campaign that the DA has been waging against independentminded De Lille, who also has had a disciplinary hearing hanging over her head. A year ago she was leader of the party in the Western Cape and had also led it to crushing the ANC and other opposition parties in the province in the 2016 local government elections. The public side of divorce between her and the DA began when she quit as provincial leader in 2017. This year, thanks to the support of opposition parties, she beat of a no-confidence vote brought before the council by her own party by one vote. While the DA caucus in the metro voted to terminate her membership, De Lille successfully fought this decision, which was supported by the DA federal executive, in court. news@afrotone.co.za -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
