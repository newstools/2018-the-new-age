BAFANA Bafana striker Luther Singh was at the receiving end of a tongue lashing by national coach Stuart Baxter for his role in the team’s 4-3 penalty shoot-out defeat to Madagascar in the Cosafa Cup on Sunday. Singh appeared casual when he stepped up to take his failed spot kick, which ended Bafana’s journey in the tournament. The Braga FC marksman attempted to dummy a shot past goalkeeper Jean Randrianasolo but it was easily saved by the Malagasy goal minder. A bitterly disappointed Baxter spoke to Singh, stressing that he was not necessarily faulting him for his penalty being saved, but his general performance throughout the match. Singh had two great chances to score but fluffed them both as Bafana were held to a goalless draw and had to go the shootout route. “He will take it hard, he is a young boy and this is his first appearance for me and he really wanted to do well,” Baxter said. “I’m more concerned with him missing two very good chances, but I have seen great players miss a penalty. I will try to explain to him that I’m more concerned about his general play. “I understand the question about his attitude because he looked very casual. But I’m guessing that’s his normal way of playing (penalties). When it doesn’t work, it doesn’t matter how.” Baxter was left frustrated by a number of misses his side had in the game. He felt they should have wrapped it up much earlier in the match. “I don’t know how many times we said this about South African football, but it is about the young players’ inexperience, it is not about getting the ball from our goal to their goal. It’s actually about finishing the job. Bafana meet Namibia in the Plate semifinal at Old Peter Mokaba Stadium tonight. -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@afrotone.co.za
