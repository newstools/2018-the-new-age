ONE of the key moments that will mark this weekend’s second Test between the Springboks and England, will be prop Tendai Mtawarira’s 100th Test cap. Mtawarira will reach the milestone should he be included in Rassie Erasmus’s team that will take on the Roses in Bloemfontein. Beast, as Mtawarira is affectionately known, will become the first African player to achieve this feat. Assistant coach Matt Proudfoot says Mtawarira has been a loyal servant for the Boks and deserves such a milestone. “It will be a fantastic achievement for a very good man and he is probably going to be the most capped prop ever,” Proudfoot said. “I think the big percentage of his caps are starts and I think it is a credible achievement for a guy to have such longevity in a tough position where there is such strong competition.” The Zimbabwean-born prop earned his first cap in 2008 and should he get the nod in Bloemfontein, he will join legends such John Smit and Percy Montmogery in the 100 club. After making his debut last weekend, young lock RG Snyman says he was happy to have marked the start of his journey with the Boks. “I must say that it is a big honour and a privilege to play for the Springboks. It is something you dream about growing up and just running out at Ellis Park was a special moment,” Snyman said. The Boks go into the second Test brimming with confidence, after taking a 1-0 lead in Johannesburg. A win for Erasmus’s men will see them seal the series win against Eddie Jones’s charges. -EZEKIEL KEKANA|ezekielk@afrotone.co.za
