THE South African Communist Party has welcomed President Cyril Ramaphosa’s appointment of a highlevel review panel, which is to be led by former Cabinet minister Sydney Mufamadi, to assess the mandate, capacity and organisational integrity of the State Security Agency (SSA). The SACP also called for similar reviews of the police, crime intelligence and the South African Police Service as a whole, including the Hawks, as well the National Prosecuting Authority to establish how the rot of corporate state capture took place as if these authorities were nonexistent and for firm, corrective action to be taken. “The SACP is pleased about the appointment of the panel on intelligence services. The panel must lay the basis for digging up all the rot in the SSA and for firm action to be taken against abuse of this state organ,” the SACP said. “All rogue intelligence activities must be exposed and uprooted from our SSA services. The SACP will be watching this process very closely.” Announcing the panel, Ramaphosa said it must seek to identify all material factors that allowed for some of the challenges to overcome the SSA, so that appropriate measures were instituted to prevent a recurrence. The main objective of the review panel is to assist in ensuring a responsible and accountable national intelligence capability in line with the Constitution and relevant legislation, Ramaphosa said. The panel members are Mufamadi, former spy boss Barry Gilder, Anthoni van Nieuwkerk, Prof Sibusiso VilNkomo, former underground intelligence operative Murray Michell, Basetsana Molebatsi, Siphokazi Magadla, former top cop Andre Pruis, Prof Jane Duncan and Silumko Sokupa. -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN|news@afrotone.co.za
