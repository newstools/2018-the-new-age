Gauteng economic development MEC Lebogang Maile, who’s in the running for the position of ANC deputy chairperson in the provincial elective conference, lashed out at the SACP for attempting to dampen his leadership ambitions. The SACP emerged last week from a bilateral meeting having raised doubts about the push to introduce a generational mix of leaders into the party’s top brass in the province. However, Maile who is set to square up with Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi for the position said at the weekend that there was nothing untoward with the motive to inject young blood in the party’s provincial leadership. “What the SACP said was unfortunate. They must say what is wrong with having a generational mix,” he said. The Gauteng ANC Youth League also came to Maile’s defence. “There is no confusion here. How can one say a generational mix is guptarisation (corruption)?” the league’s deputy chairperson, Vuyo Mhaga asked. SACP provincial chairperson Joe Mpisi said the party was “worried at the way this word (generational mix) is being used” -AfroVoice Reporter
