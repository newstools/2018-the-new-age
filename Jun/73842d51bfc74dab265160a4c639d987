The Menlyn Shopping Centre was a hive of activity when Turkish menswear brand, DS Damat made its return to South Africa. Among the stars that came out to witness the occasion , last Thursday, were singer Langa Mavuso,  actor, Kay Sibiya, comedian Donovan Goliath as well as former soccer players Fani Madida, Pollen Ndlaya and Doctor Khumalo. Madida who plyed his trade in Turkey said he has always been a fan of the menswear brand and during his stay in Turkey, he made it his business to dress in the best Turkish fabrics which the brand inherits.“Turkey is known for its strong fashion and fabric tradition. Having stayed there as a soccer player, I came to love what DS Damat stand for and remember when they used to sponsor my former football team Kaizer Chiefs. Those were the good years as the players connected with the brand and carried themselves as professionals. Maybe the decline in the team’s fortunes has something to do with how they dress and carry themselves on and off the field, maybe they need to to dress up well to revive their luck, who knows,” Madida  jokingly said. The store was officially opened by the Ambassador of Turkey Pule Malefane and returns courtesy of franchise owner Callistus Phologolo, who in 2017, opened his first D’S damat store in Botswana. Malefane, said the return of the brand into the country meant economic opportunities for the two countries.“Despite all the challenges we are faced with in the country there is an opportunity to position our country as one of the successful economies in the world and this relationship should not be viewed as a threat but must be embraced as supplementing the efforts of ensuring that we are able to produce affordable quality products that can be appreciated by the global market”,’ Malefane said. siyabongas@afrotone.co.za
