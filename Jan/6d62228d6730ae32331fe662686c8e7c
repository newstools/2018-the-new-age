The DA in Gauteng says former Gauteng health MEC Qedani Mahlangu must accept responsibility for the deaths in the Life Esidimeni tragedy. “I hope that she avoids any more stalling tactics and testifies openly and truthfully without her previous arrogance that led to this tragedy in which 143 people died,” DA shadow health MEC Jack Bloom said in a statement on Sunday. Mahlangu is expected to testify at the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings on Monday. In November, the former MEC’s lawyers revealed that she would testify at the arbitration hearings from 22 to 26 January. This after allegations that she refused to cooperate with the commission. Mahlangu has however dismissed allegations that she ran away or disappeared. During her tenure as Gauteng health MEC, about 36 patients, who were moved from Life Esidimeni facilities to various NGOs, died as a result of starvation and neglect at the unequipped facilities that they were sent to. However, Health Ombudsman  has confirmed that the death toll has risen to over 140. The DA said it expected Mahlangu to answer key questions, including her reasons for cancelling the Life Esidimeni contract. “Why did she ignore so persistently all the warnings that moving so many patients to NGOs would lead to deaths? What information did she provide to Premier David Makhura and the executive council in this matter, and what was their complicity in the decisions that were taken?” The DA said Mahlangu should acknowledge her personal and direct responsibility for this terrible tragedy rather than blame officials as scapegoats. -TNA Reporter
