ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa says, as much as he believes that state capture is not a new phenomenon and it has been going on for years, the commission announced by President Jacob Zuma to investigate allegations of state capture should confine itself to the report authored by former public protector Thuli Madonsela. Ramaphosa was speaking during a wide-ranging interview with ANN7’s Sfiso Mahlangu. Ramaphosa said it was important to investigate Madonsela’s findings because there was evidence and many witnesses who could still answer questions. The ANC president also condemned the booing of officials during Saturday’s January 8 statement rally in East London. “I did hear the booing. That is why when I got up to speak, I admonished it. You should treat others the way you want to be treated.” At the same time, Ramaphosa said the economy had been deliberately structured to exclude black people and deformed. “With everyone agreeing that this economy is deformed, we need to structure it.” Ramaphosa also condemned US President Donald Trump’s most recent utterances where he referred to some African countries and others like Haiti and El Salvador as “sh**holes”. “What Mr Trump is alleged to have said is hugely offensive. His statement demonstrates the type of person he is.” -TNA Reporter
