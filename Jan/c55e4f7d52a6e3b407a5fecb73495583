THE DA’s federal executive has decided to formally charge and investigate Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille for bringing the party into disrepute and damaging its image. The charges relate to allegations of intimidation, criminality and misconduct levelled against some of Cape Town’s most senior staff. DA leader Mmusi Maimane announced the decision yesterday after considering De Lille’s submission on why she should not resign in the wake of a report based on the findings of a subcommittee headed by parliamentary whip John Steenhuisen into tensions and political management. De Lille remains mayor but will not be part of the city’s response to the water crisis. The DA will not support a motion of no confidence against De Lille while the matter against her is being dealt with by the party’s federal legal commission. “We spent a lot of time deliberating the matter and the mayor must report for duty. Her suspension from party activity will continue,” Maimane said. He said certain responsibilities taken away from the mayoral committee when De Lille restructured would be returned. De Lille will have to appear before the federal legal commission, which has been given 60 days to complete its work. De Lille will be charged with interfering in the city of Cape Town’s administration, failing to ensure allegations against city transport commissioner Melissa Whitehead were investigated. De Lille welcomed the probe, saying she would defend herself against all charges. She added it was disappointing that “they are already stripping me of my powers, which they are not allowed to do in terms of my statutory duties, before the disciplinary process has been concluded”. De Lille said she noted the resolutions which did “not include a demand for my resignation or allowing a motion of no confidence in me”. -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
