A Welkom businessman is expected to appear at the Welkom Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday, following his arrest for alleged human trafficking. The 50-year-old was arrested by the Hawks’ Organised Crime Unit on Tuesday. Saps Provincial spokesperson S’fiso Nkakane said the businessman handed himself over to the Hawks office after the team rescued ten victims from his farm at Khune village and lodge that was allegedly operating as a brothel. Victims were rescued after information was received from Interpol concerning a victim who was being kept at the farm against his will. Six suspects were also arrested when the victims were found and have appeared before the Welkom and Odendaalsrus Magistrate’s Court on Friday. “Investigations are continuing, and further arrests cannot be ruled out,” Nyakane said. -TNA Reporter
