The ANC says it is happy with a decision by the party caucus in the city of Cape Town to withdraw a motion of no confidence against Executive Mayor Patricia de Lille. The party has said that while de Lille is the face of a corrupt, dysfunctional municipality, she is just one cog of a bigger problem that is the DA and its patronage networks within the city. ANC spokesperson Khusela Diko said the DA wanted to opportunistically hijack the motion of no confidence brought by the ANC against de Lille, to resolve its own internal squabbles over resources linked to the city’s water crisis. “It is a common cause that the Auditor General has raised serious concerns about collapsing financial controls in that municipality. This relates to, among others, unbridled bias in awarding of tenders , taxpayers’ monies used for upgrades at de Lille’s home, tender manipulation and other acts of financial misconduct as factions within the DA fall over themselves to eat at the trough of corruption whilst hiding behind the genuine grievances of the people of Cape Town and the very dire water situation in that region,” Diko said. She said the ANC also unequivocally supported the call by the ANC caucus for the national government to intervene in the city’s current water crisis. “Whilst the DA continues to blame everyone but themselves for the impending crisis in the city, the national government must continue with its commendable efforts to fight on the side of the people and do everything in their power to step in where this DA fails to govern.” -TNA Reporter
