President Jacob Zuma has filed court papers to appeal a ruling that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa should appoint a national director of public prosecutions (NDPP). Zuma argued yesterday that the Pretoria high court, which ruled in December last year that National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams should vacate his office and that Ramaphosa had two months to appoint a new NPA head, “erred in law in holding it to be constitutionally permissible to have two presidents in the country at the same time and both exercising presidential powers”. Judge president Dunstan Mlambo said at the time that while Abrahams should vacate his seat, Zuma was too conflicted to appoint a new NPA head, as he himself faces possible prosecution over corruption charges. “In our view, President Zuma would clearly be conflicted in having to appoint an NDPP, given the background to which we have referred, particularly the ever-present spectre of the many criminal charges against him that have not gone away,” the court ruling said. This came as various organisations have gone to court seeking an order declaring former NPA head Mxolisi Nxasana’s removal invalid. -TNA Reporter
