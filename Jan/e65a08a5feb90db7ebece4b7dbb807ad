Late music legend Hugh Masekela’s family has made public plans for his memorial services and funeral. Masekela’s family and friends gathered in Parktown, Johannesburg on Thursday, to release details of the ceremonies that will take place in honour of Bra Hugh. Masekela’s son Selema Mabena “Sal” Masekela said the week ahead represented a time where everyone would be able to say their final goodbyes to the global jazz icon. The first event is the Hugh Masekela Heritage Park, an audio visual celebration of the artist that will chronicle his six decades as a musician and political, social and cultural activist. “There will also be a temporary visitation place from 26 January to 1 February, at the heritage park. It will have visuals, footage and audio that we have created to reflect his life,” Selema said. The second event will take place at the San Kopano community centre on Friday. Family, friends and a community of artists will gather and share their memories of Bra Hugh. Lastly, the family will host the Hugh Masekela Musical Memorial on Sunday at the University of Johannesburg. “This will be a musical celebration of Bra Hugh’s life, featuring different artists.” The funeral will be a private ceremony, with family and friends and the media will not be allowed to attend. -TNA Reporter
