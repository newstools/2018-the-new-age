The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is offering a reward of up to $10 000 (R121 580.55) for information that could lead to the arrest of Barrett Preston Busschau, who is wanted in connection for the alleged molestation of young girls in Oregon. According to the FBI, Busschau, now 42 year’s old, may be living in South Africa. “Busschau is a native of South Africa and he had been living in the United States since 1984 as a legal permanent resident. Investigators believe he may have traveled to California and/or Panama following his disappearance but the last known sighting of him places him in South Africa.” Busschau disappeared from Oregon in 1993 after Clackamas County authorities arrested him on multiple sex abuse charges involving children. On 27 July 1993, a Clackamas County grand jury indicted Buscchau for the alleged molestation of five girls between the ages of 10 and 15. He was 18 years old at the time.
