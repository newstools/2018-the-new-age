Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said South African citizens always want to see justice done without fear, favour and prejudice. “We have the rule of law in our country and people always want to see justice done, without fear or favour. So whatever will need to be done to President Zuma will have to follow the due process of the law,” Ramaphosa said in an interview with BBC’s Hard Talk. He said this while answering the question of whether he would pardon President Jacob Zuma should he be found guilty. Zuma could face charges of corruption, fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to the arms deal. The ANC President also told the media that Zuma had not asked immunity from prosecution. Late last year the Supreme Court of Appeal upheld the North Gauteng High Court ruling to reinstate the against Zuma. In 2009 Mokotedi Mpshe head of the prosecuting authority at the time set aside the charges, arguing that there was a political interference. Meanwhile, Zuma has established a commission of inquiry into the alleged state of capture, will investigate claims made by the former deputy Minister of Finance Mcebisi Jonas that he was offered a ministerial position by the Gupta family. The terms of reference of the inquiry, broadly based on the former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s State of Capture report, was released on Thursday. -TNA Reporter
