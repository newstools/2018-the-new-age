THREE powerful parliamentary oversight committees, among them the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa), will try to unravel the Steinhoff debacle in public hearings over the last two days of this month. This was announced by chairperson of the standing committee on finance, Yunus Carrim, yesterday. Confirming that his committee would be part of the probe, Carrim named the other oversight committees as Scopa and the public service and administration portfolio committee. Carrim rejected a claim by DA MP David Maynier that the hearings on Steinhoff were as a result of a request from him. “Actually, I acted immediately after the issue broke out and decided that the committee would have to have hearings on this matter well before Maynier wrote to me and rushed to the media,” Carrim said. “I also received a call from EFF MP Floyd Shivambu regarding the matter. Godi (Scopa chairperson Themba Godi) had also already issued a statement,” he said. news@thenewage.co.za
