The big debate about which song ushered South Africans into the new year will soon come to an end, as a new method for the SABC Summer Song of the Year selection has been adopted. In previous years, confusion was created when there was no outright winner of the No 1 song, which created heated debate around the country. This year, SABC’s 18 radio stations were tasked to come up with their own No 1 song which would walk away with R10000. Owen Ndlovu of Michael Ndlovu Productions and facilitator of the competition said: “This year, for the first time ever, the No 1 or the top song on each radio station has been rewarded with R10000. We are yet to meet with the radio stations to see which one is the overall hit song which will also pocket R150000 and the R10000. “If it’s No 1 on all the radio stations it will receive R180000 plus R150000.” Ndlovu said picking the No 1 hit song had proven to be a tricky situation and they had decided to launch this new method sometime later this month during the crowning of the various winners from New Years Eve party. “We appeal to the public to forward suggestions on how we can improve the process of crowning winners,” he said. The long-standing festive season tradition in South Africa, which is to have an ultimate song that ushers the country into the new year, was highly contested with more than 10 songs. Although the gqom genre has taken the music industry by storm, other sounds have proven to be stiff competition. Sun-EL Musician featuring Samthing Soweto released an instant hit, Akanamali, which turned into a love anthem and was also on top of the list alongside Distruction Boyz’s Omunye. nontokozog@thenewage.co.za
