City of Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille says the statement issued by the Democratic Alliance (DA) calling for her dismissal does not represent the caucus in the city of Cape Town. She said the regional executive needed to provide proof of when it met with the branches and what mandate it received from them. De Lille said the caucus, chaired by Regional Executive Grant Twigg was meant to represent DA branches, as well as DA members. In a statement posted on Facebook, by Twigg‚ the party called for the removal of de Lille as mayor and also rejected the proposed drought levy. De Lille was put on suspension from all party activities by the DA after allegations emerged that she had used public money to do renovations at her house. De Lille has denied all allegations of corruption against her. She said she has a very impeccable record of fighting corruption. “My record is clear. I have a record of fighting corruption in South Africa.” She said she is giving those who wrote the report calling for her removal until tomorrow, to fix it. She said Twiggs’ statement is an illustration that attacks on her are about power and positions. De Lille said, should the DA fail to rectify the inaccuracies on the statement, she will approach the court to seek redress. -TNA Reporter
