An escapee, who was allegedly granted bail through fraudulent means, will appear in the Modimolle Magistrate’s Court today after he was rearrested. Jack Opperman was rearrested in Potchefstroom with a woman he allegedly met on Facebook under a false name, Herman Calitz, following a tip-off. Opperman had appeared in the Modimolle Magistrate’s Court in September 2017 where he was remanded in custody. According to police spokesperson Motlafela Mojapelo, Opperman was thereafter taken to Pretoria for detention. “He somehow managed to pay bail to the amount of R500, which was never granted during his court appearance. The suspect was supposed to appear again in the same court on Monday in October but he was nowhere to be found,” Mojapelo said. Mojapelo said Opperman was initially arrested in Witbank in August 2017 after defrauding several victims. “It is understood that he was advertising buffalos for sale and was subsequently paid about R60 000 by unsuspecting victims who made deposits into his account. He then disappeared. Three cases of fraud were then opened against him and a search ensued.” He said preliminary investigations at the time showed that Opperman was possibly assisted by officials. According to Mojapelo, Opperman will face a charge of escaping from lawful custody and defeating the ends of justice. He said the police were also conducting an internal investigation into who may have helped Opperman escape. -TNA Reporter
