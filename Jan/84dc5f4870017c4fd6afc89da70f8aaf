A GLANCE at Mamelodi Sundowns’ last match may give Ajax Cape Town and their new coach Muhsin Ertugral a bit of hope ahead of tonight’s clash. But the story goes deeper than Sundowns giving away their lead to end up losing 3-2 to Bernard Molekwa’s Polokwane City at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday. Given Sundowns have failed to win their last match, the fact that they have an angry coach in Pitso Mosimane makes the assignment even tougher for Ajax. For starters, Mosimane is demanding an immediate response and at the moment there is no clue as to which Sundowns will pitch up at Cape Town Stadium at 7:30pm. Mosimane has come down hard on Sundowns players such as Themba Zwane, Anthony Laffor, Percy Tau and Oupa Manyisa, urging them to give a performance that protects the Brazilians’ integrity better than they did in the last game. “What do I coach? I was very angry in the last match. “They have to put the ball in the net. It is very difficult for us as coaches. “We were on a Christmas break against Polokwane City. I am very angry at my players,” Mosimane said. “We did not protect our integrity in the last game. “Hopefully the next one against Ajax Cape Town will be better. I would appreciate it if the loss on Saturday is a wakeup call. Maybe that is what we needed,” the Sundowns coach said. As Sundowns will be forced to play without the injured Khama Billiat and Sibusiso Vilakazi, the Urban Warriors could well unleash the potent strike partnership of Tendai Ndoro and Fagrie Lakay that can terrorise any team in the PSL when at their best. Ertugral will also be looking for an improved performance after his side gave away a goal lead to lose 2-1 to Maritzburg United and slip deeper into the relegation zone. The Urban Warriors only have 13 points from 15 matches, having won only three this season. Their opponents Sundowns are top with 28 points that they have managed to earn from their nine wins out of 15 matches.  -MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
