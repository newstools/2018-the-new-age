Former Miss South Africa Jo-Ann Strauss is pregnant! The media personality, public speaker and businesswoman announced she is expecting her third child with husband Michael Held in an Instagram post early on Wednesday. Excited to say that we are expanding our family in 2018  Hence my social media inactivity for the past few weeks. Been down with debilitating morning sickness 24 hours a day. Hopefully, it’ll get better soon, but grateful for the blessing of having another little angel. Third pregnancy means the bump debuts a lot earlier than with the first also didn’t think through the idea of a high-waisted skirt … anyway, this was my look for #AfricanChic to MC the #BMWSAOpen event last night. Love pairing designer items and thrifty purchases. Bought the skirt at @klukcgdt and t-shirt R99 at the airport. Strauss married Held in 2012. -TNA Reporter
