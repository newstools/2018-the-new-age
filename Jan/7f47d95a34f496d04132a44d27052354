A SAPS police captain with links to former national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane is due to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court today on charges of fraud and theft. This comes after his arrest by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) yesterday when he reported to his parole officer at the Correctional Services offices. Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini said: “The arrest follows an investigation into the looting of the Secret Service account and theft of funds. The investigation started in 2017 after complaints were received by Ipid.” Meanwhile, former Free State head of police crime intelligence service MajGen Agnes Makhele will appear in court next month for obstructing the investigation into Phahlane. She has been accused of running a counter-investigation through crime intelligence to protect Phahlane who is being investigated for allegedly taking kickbacks from police suppliers in return for contracts. -KEITUMETSI MOTLHALE|keitumetsim@thenewage.co.za
