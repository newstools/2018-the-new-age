Numsa has convened a meeting with workers on Wednesday to present the formalised wage offer from Wits University management. The Numsa members have been on strike to demand higher wages at the institution. Acting spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola said the major sticking point is the fact that the majority of their members fell into grade 16 and 17 which is the category reserved for the lowest earners. “Workers in grade 16 and 17 were formerly employed by labour brokers and received the lowest salaries of all employees at Wits.” The university’s management has since offered them a 9.20% increase. “Furthermore the university has proposed to establish a task team to integrate these workers fully into grade 15 by July this year. This will bring the lowest paid workers closer to the goal of achieving a living wage. “They will earn the same as other workers who fulfill the same job description,” Hlubi-Majola said. Wits also proposed to increase salaries of workers between grades 5-8 by 7% and grade 9-15 by 7.80%. Hlubi-Majola added that Numsa is worker controlled and therefore cannot sign the final offer until our members have seen it and satisfied themselves that it contains clauses which they agreed to. “Thereafter it is likely that all parties will sign the final agreement later today.” -TNA Reporter
