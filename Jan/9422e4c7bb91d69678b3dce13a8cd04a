Radio Personality Motsweding FM DJ Lara Kruger has died. The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) confirmed on Wednesday that it was informed of Miss Lara Kruger’s death. In a statement, SABC said: “Lara will be remembered for the immense contribution at the SABC as a presenter of Motsweding FM’s weekend show Di direga kae, since joining the station in 2016. Lara’s contribution to the SABC will remain and continue to inspire those who knew her on a personal and professional level.” The exact details around her death are not clear, but according to her manager Boipelo Ditshego, Lara had undergone treatment for depression. Born Thapelo Lehuleri, as a transgendered woman, Lara became a voice for the LGBIT community in South Africa. Several Motsweding FM listeners have taken to Twitter to pay their tribute to Lara and asked why it took so long for the station to announce her death. @MissLaraKruger posted this and this morning we heard that she has passed on. Believe me not, our smiles don’t mean we are always happy, some people hurt us as if we don’t breathe the same air. Lost o setlhogo maan  o tshwana fela le motho
RIP Lara Kruger
