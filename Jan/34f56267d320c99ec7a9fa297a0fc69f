The African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) congratulates Banyana Banyana for being crowned the 2017 Confederation African Football (CAF) National Team of the year at the AITEO CAF Awards, in Ghana. ANCWL Secretary General Meokgo Matuba said the team’s achievement is an incredible milestone for women in sport in South Africa. It proves that given an equal opportunity, women can excel in any sporting code. “The Organisation urges the African National Congress (ANC) led government and Corporate sector to invest more resources in women sports development, especially at grassroots level.” ANCWL urges all its supporters, members and society, in general, to fight for promotion of equality, representation and redress in sport. “Women and young girls must be encouraged and supported to actively participate in sports,” Matuba said. -TNA Reporter
