DA has announced that the state of rail infrastructure in Geldenhuis is shocking. Following an oversight visit at the Geldenhuis train station on Thursday, the party says the Ministers’ claims that ‘there is no crisis’ are proven otherwise. DA’s oversight was a follow-up on the four derailments in less than a month including the 9 January train accident in Germiston, which left over 200 people injured. The party’s Transport Shadow Minister Manny de Freitas MP said the commuters had complaints of the damaged infrastructure at the train stations and poor conditions of trains. “We saw clear signs of vandalism and criminals having free reign on the rail system. Commuters also complained about late trains, and how they fear that more train accidents could potentially claim their lives.” De Freitas added that DA has called on the Minister of Transport Joe Maswanganyi to urgently address the issues at PRASA. “We propose that the government implement the following actions steps with the necessary urgency. “This situation is creating an environment for criminals to thrive and the unsafe railway lines demonstrate lack of leadership and investment by PRASA.”
