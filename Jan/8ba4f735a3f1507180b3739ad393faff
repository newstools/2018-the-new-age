ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa has praised the role played by the Zulu monarch in the formation of the ANC and for its role in the struggle against apartheid. Ramaphosa said the role of the monarch and that of other traditional leaders could not be overlooked by the ANC. He was speaking in Nongoma yesterday where the top leadership of the party, some national executive committee members and provincial leaders of the party paid a courtesy visit to King Goodwill Zwelithini. He said one of the Zulu kings, Dinizulu, who is the great-grandfather of the reigning Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini, was at the forefront of the formation of the ANC. “As many of us know, king Dinizulu, who was incarcerated, was one of those who was involved in the formation of the ANC. So this royal family is the home of the ANC,” Ramaphosa said. As part of the build-up to the January 8 statement, which will take place in East London on Saturday, Ramaphosa said they would lay wreaths on the graves of former ANC presidents from KZN today. They will start at Josiah Gumede’s grave in Pietermaritzburg, go to KwaDukuza to chief Albert Luthuli’s grave and finish at John Dube’s grave in Durban. Meanwhile, the ANC has remained mum on the issue of the KZN provincial executive committee (PEC), which is led by Sihle Zikalala. The PEC has been under pressure to vacate office ever since the Pietermaritzburg High Court ruled on September 12 that it was elected to office unlawfully. Asked by the media outside the palace about the issue, the ANC’s secretary-general, Ace Magashule, said they wouldn’t respond to the matter. He said the PEC was in office after appealing both the September ruling and the December 15 ruling that disbanded it and forced it out of office. sihlem@thenewage.co.za
