Police in Mankweng, Limpopo have opened an inquest case after a 39-year-old man drowned in Ga-Rapheri dam on Sunday. It is alleged that the deceased was fishing using a self-made boat when it capsized. An eyewitness informed the police the search immediately began and the body was only recovered during early hours of Saturday. On another incident the body of a 48-year-old woman was found floating in the Khujwana dam in Limpopo. The cause of deaths in both cases remains unknown but the police investigations are continuing. The police have since issued precautions to the communities to be careful around dam waters. “We want to warn members of the community that as much this year’s seasonal rains are minimal, the current waters in our dams can still be life threatening if approached without the necessary precautions,” Limpopo SAPS said in statement. -TNA Reporter
