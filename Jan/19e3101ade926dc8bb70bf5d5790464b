ALL of four months after having requested a copy of a report on disciplinary matters in the South African Police Service’s crime intelligence unit and an HR account of more than 1400 members with criminal records, Parliament’s police portfolio committee is still waiting. In a statement the chairperson of the committee, Franscois Beukman, called on the national commissioner of police Lt-Gen Khehla Sitole to redouble efforts to deal with corrupt SAPS members. “The national commissioner of police should move faster to deal with corrupt cops and those who are allegedly involved in criminal enterprises,” Beukman said. “The portfolio committee is concerned that several SAPS members have been arrested and there are serious allegations against high-ranking members before the courts but its management is not taking proactive and appropriate disciplinary steps.” Urging Sitole to ensure that SAPS’s credibility was restored, Beukman said that the new management should work harder on all these matters to ensure that public confidence in their abilities did not falter. Beukman said that the portfolio committee welcomed the recent break throughs by the directorate of priority crime investigation (DPCI/Hawks) in the arrests of SAPS members allegedly involved in criminal activity. “The committee commends the excellent work of the DPCI in this regard. “The portfolio committee on police is still awaiting the Ledwaba report on disciplinary matters within crime intelligence and the HR report on more than 1 400 SAPS members with criminal records, which it requested in October.” -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
