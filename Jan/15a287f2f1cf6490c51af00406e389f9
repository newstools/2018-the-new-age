Dis-Chem employees affiliated to National Union of Public Service and Allied Workers (Nupsaw) protested outside Dis-Chem head offices in Midrand on Wednesday. The workers are demanding that the employer must grant them the right for union affiliation as in terms of section 21 of the Labour Relations Act (LRA). They are also demanding higher wages and better working conditions. “We want management to pay our members annual bonuses, we want the employer to recognise the union with immediate effect. The employer is under the impression that we are going to massage them. We are not here to impress the employer. We are going to fight up until our demands are reached,” Nupsaw spokesperson Solly Malema said. The dispute between Nupsaw and Dis-Chem could not be resolved through the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) last year which has led to the industrial action. Some of the workers who spoke to ANN7 have accused Dis-Chem of racism and discrimination saying that the company made it difficult for a black worker to progress to senior management level. He said that the company implemented a lot of unjust ‘laws’ that hindered progress for black workers. The industrial action has also been supported by the South African Federation of Trade Unions. “SAFTU backs its affiliate, the National Union of Public Service and Allied Workers [NUPSAW], which is preparing for a strike at DisChem Pharmacies starting on 17 Jan 2018 at their places of work across the country,” Saftu said. -TNA Reporter
