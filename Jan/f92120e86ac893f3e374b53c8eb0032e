DA Provincial Spokesperson on Education Jacques Smalle has on Wednesday said that MEC Ishmael Kgetjepe should be held accountable for misleading the portfolio committee and the non-delivery of textbooks to schools. This comes after the Department of Education in Limpopo has failed once again to deliver textbooks and Learner Teacher Support Material (LTSM) to more than 222 schools across the province in time for the new academic year. “It is clear that MEC for this department, Ishmael Kgetjepe, lied and misled the Portfolio Committee on Education late last year that a service provider had been appointed for the next three years to deliver textbooks to all the schools in Limpopo before 2018 academic year resumes today,” Smalle said. He indicated that DA is deeply concerned about the continuous non-delivery of textbooks especially in each and every new academic year since 2012 and the impact it has on many schools and learners across the province. “It’s apparent that these schools will be forced to use their norms and standards budget to purchase some of the textbooks. The failure to deliver textbooks on time proves a lack of planning that continues to hamper the learners’ chances of having a successful academic year once again.” The DA urges the Department to deliver all the outstanding textbooks and LTSM to these schools before Friday to ensure that learning and teaching run smoothly without any further disruption to the academic year. -TNA Reporter
