The DA says the revelations by Minister of Public Enterprises Lynne Brown on financial state at state-owned entities indicates lack of oversight and gross mismanagement by the national government. “This failure has a direct consequence for small businesses which deal with the department as they are worst affected, often facing closure as a result of late payments by government departments.” This comes after Minister Brown’s revelations on the undesirable financial state which state’s arms manufacturer Denel, Transnet and Eskom find themselves in. “In her reply, Brown indicated that the department currently owes over R1.532 billion to its suppliers. Moreover, a total of 61 063 invoices have not been paid within the prescribed 30 days after an invoice has been submitted – the main culprits being Denel, Transnet and Eskom, that owe an appalling R688 million, R728 million and R102 million respectively,” DA said. The revelations were recently made in a reply to a parliamentary question that was asked by an MP. The DA accuses Brown of failing to provide leadership as these entities which are being led by her. “The shocking figures point to nothing other than a complete lack of oversight at national level and gross mismanagement at the entity level, both spearheaded by the Minister. “The failure of our state-owned entities must be placed squarely at the feet of the Minister of Public Enterprises, Lynne Brown,” the DA added. Meanwhile, the party says it will write to the Public Enterprises Committee to invite entity heads and the Department of Public Enterprises to account before the committee for late payments and to provide concrete steps to remedy this crisis. -TNA Reporter
