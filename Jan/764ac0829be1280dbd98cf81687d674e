THE National Assembly is to begin to draft a procedure for the removal from office of a sitting president on Wednesday and Thursday. Last month, in a majority ruling in a matter brought before it by the EFF, UDM and Cope, the Constitutional Court declared that the National Assembly had failed to make rules to deal with Section 89 of the Constitution. It ordered the National Assembly to remedy this and to hold the president to account without any delay. Parliament said in a statement yesterday: “The Constitutional Court ordered the National Assembly to make such rules without delay to initiate a process under section 89(1), in terms of the newly developed rules.” This week’s meetings of the National Assembly subcommittee on review of rules will deliberate on a draft procedure for implementing section 89(1) of the Constitution. In keeping with the Assembly’s commitment to comply with the Constitutional Court’s judgment, Parliament said MPs serving on the National Assembly rules subcommittee had been notified of forthcoming meetings and supplied with documents to be considered there. “The documents include a draft procedure drawn up in April 2016, but not finalised, and a comparative study, compiled in 2015, about impeachment proceedings of seven other parliaments on the removal of a head of state.” The draft procedure, once finalised by the subcommittee, must be adopted by the National Assembly as part of the Assembly’s rules. -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN|dennisc@thenewage.co.za
