Nine officials, including vehicle examiners and administration staff, are due to appear in court on charges of fraud and corruption on Monday. The officials were arrested at two privately owned vehicle testing stations last week after members of the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC)’s National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit raided the Mamelodi vehicle testing station in Tshwane and First Class Vehicle Inspections in Midrand. “Six officials, three males and three females, who were arrested in Mamelodi are expected to appear in the Pretoria Commercial Crimes Court,” RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said. He said three males, who were arrested in Midrand, will appear in the Johannesburg Commercial Crimes Court on Tuesday. It is alleged that the suspects fraudulently and irregularly issued roadworthy certificates to vehicles that were not physically taken to the testing stations for examination. “Five roadworthy testing stations have been raided in the past month and investigations have revealed widespread malpractices. Law enforcement authorities will continue their relentless clampdown in an effort to fight corruption and improve road safety.” -TNA Reporter
