Bra Sandy held my hand when I started directing at @etvScandal. He’d call me over to his table during breakfast and say “keep your head up, you’re doing good.” Eish… RIP #SandyMokwena — Mmabatho Montsho (@MmabathoMontsho) January 25, 2018 To the man that smiled and told me I was the perfect fit for ‘Xolile Langa’ on my first day…Rest well old man. The cast and crew of @etvScandal will surely miss you. We love you #BraEddie #RIPSANDYMOKWENA pic.twitter.com/hBBLhmqqEV — Sivenathi Mabuya (@sivemabuya) January 25, 2018 Oh Daddy
