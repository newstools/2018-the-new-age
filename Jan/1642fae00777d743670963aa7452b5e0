KwaZulu-Natal agriculture and rural development MEC Themba Mthembu has welcomed a court decision to deny bail to a farmer accused of killing a man on his farm earlier this year. Edward Phillip Solomon was remanded in custody on Thursday following a failed bid to secure bail after he was arrested for shooting and killing former farm worker Mondli Lembede. Mthembu said the decision by the New Hanover Magistrateâ€™s Court sent a strong message to people who marginalised farm workers and farm dwellers. He called on all farming communities in the province to maintain peace and harmony within its members, in order to foster a prosperous agricultural community formed on the values of non-racial, non-sexist and democratic society, underpinned by human rights and freedoms. -TNA Reporter
