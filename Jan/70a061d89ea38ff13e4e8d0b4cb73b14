Former Prasa CEO Lucky Montana has made a damning allegation that former ANC Treasurer General Zweli Mkhize attempted to strong-arm him into handing over 10% of a rail contract back in 2014. Montana made the allegations while appearing before parliaments inquiry into state capture at State-Owned Entities. According to the former CEO, Zweli Mkhize alongside now Deputy Finance Minister Sfiso Buthelezi met him at the Sandton Sun hotel. Montana said that Mkhize wanted part of an R465 million to be awarded to a locally based consortium and they wanted 10% of the fee. However, claims to have refused the alleged overtures at which point the former TG “attacked” him. “What the former TG wanted he then said, we are giving an R50bn to French colonialists with a terrible record in Africa. You guys are involved in these deals and are getting a lot of money,” he said. Montana further alleges that former Transport Minister Dipuo Peters and Mkhize then set about to ensure that the board at Prasa was changed. Montana also made allegations of being followed as well as one incident where a man followed him into his yard when he was returning home one day. He said he chased the man away with a firearm which had been provided as part of his contract with the state-owned company. Montana who left Prasa back in 2015 also accused members of the Gupta family as well as Duduzane Zuma for attempting to direct the restructuring of the board of Prasa. -TNA Reporter
