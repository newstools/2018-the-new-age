Ngwathe local municipality yesterday denied they were supplying unpurified water in Koppies. This followed after some of the Kwakwatsi township residents complained that the water from the taps was dirty. They said the colour of the water was brown or orange and it was unpleasant for them to drink it. “Sometimes the water is clean but most of the time it is dirty,” unhappy residents said. One resident, Thabo Keko, said they had been complaining to the authorities for a long time about the quality of the water but nothing had been done. “Our ward councillors know about this problem and they had promised to solve this but nothing has been done so far,” he said. Another resident, who wanted to remain anonymous, said they were afraid to drink the water because they could get sick. Municipal spokesperson Steve Naale denied they were supplying unpurified water to the residents. He said they were a responsible municipality and they knew it would be a health hazard to provide unsafe water. “We can confirm that the water purification process in Koppies and Kwakwatsi is permanent and ongoing so as to ensure that water being supplied and distributed to residents is safe for human consumption,” Naale said. “However, we have experienced a few scenarios when the colour of the water changed as a result of burst pipes, which were attended to immediately,” Naale said. He said the recent appointment of a new water and sanitation manager aimed to improve the situation while at the same time running the save water campaigns. “We are also encouraging our residents in all areas within the municipality to report water leaks immediately so that we can save it,” Naale said. beckers@thenewage.co.za
