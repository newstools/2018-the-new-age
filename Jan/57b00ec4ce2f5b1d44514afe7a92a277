Gauteng police on Tuesday confirmed that no arrests have yet been made in the unfolding Reiger Park High School school sex scandal but have assured that investigations into the matter are ongoing. The community has been outraged ever since videos and images of the school’s former principal went viral on social media where he was seen engaging in sexual acts with a pupil and female staff member. According to Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, all teachers and workers implicated in the video have been removed from the school.

We are also going to permanently station social workers at the school,” Lesufi said. On Monday, angry residents marched to the school and handed over a memorandum to government officials. The memorandum demands the replacement of the school governing body (SGB) and the firing of all staff members identified in the videos. On Tuesday, Lesufi confirmed that from 1 March there would be a new SGB. “We also know that in that video there are people who are not teachers.” On Monday, Ekurhuleni mayoral committee member for human settlements Lesiba Mpya confirmed that he had gone to the Reiger Park police station in order to determine whether there were grounds to open a case of statutory rape. -TNA Reporter
