ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa promised to revamp the domestic economy during his first speech as the ruling party’s president in East London on Saturday. He also promised to deliver 1 million jobs, mainly for young people. Ramaphosa said the concentration of ownership in the hands of whites constrains sustainable growth and transformation. “We will work to change the ownership structure of our economy through ensuring access to and ownership of financial institutions by black people, youths and women. “This includes new approaches to regulation and licensing in the financial sector to foster diversified ownership and competition,” Ramaphosa said. He added that development finance institutions and state banks should be directed to give greater emphasis to employment creation, empowerment, industrial diversification and the development of small businesses and cooperatives. “SA needs to pursue a multifaceted growth strategy. We need to revitalise manufacturing through a number of measures, including preferential procurement in the private and public sectors,” he said. -BERNARD SATHEKGE|bernards@thenewage.co.za
