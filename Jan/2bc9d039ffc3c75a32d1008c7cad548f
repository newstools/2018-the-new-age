The ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) will on Thursday pay a courtesy visit to the home of late former President Nelson Mandela in Qunu in the Eastern Cape. This is one of the many events that the party will be attending in its build-up to the January 8th statement rally, which will take place at the Absa Stadium in East London on Saturday. ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said members of the NEC, led by national officials, would take part in a series of activities, as part of the build-up programme to reconnect with the people and mobilise them to attend the ANC’s 106th birthday celebration rally. The visit is in line with an announcement by the NEC earlier this week that it will be laying wreaths at the graves of the party’s deceased leaders. On Monday, the leadership laid wreaths at the graves of John Langalibalele Dube, Josiah Gumede, Pixley Seme and Albert Luthuli in KwaZulu-Natal. During the event, party President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that he and his newly elected top six would be traveling around the country to honour leaders of the party who have since passed on. -TNA Reporter
