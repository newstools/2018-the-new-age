Police spokesperson Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said the father of the suspect went missing after he promised to help officials to find his son. “We are still on a manhunt for the suspect. We are also looking for the suspect’s father after he also went missing in action. We have just discussed with the branch commander to make available a recent photo of the suspect,” Bhembe said.
