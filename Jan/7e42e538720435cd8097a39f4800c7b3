The Nelson Mandela Foundation has said it’s “truly saddened” by the passing of jazz maestro Hugh Masekela. Masekela died on Tuesday, at the age of 78, following a battle with prostate cancer. The foundation’s CEO, Sello Hatang, said while the Masekela family had lost one of their own, music lovers had lost a part of their souls. “For us, Bra Hugh was not just an internationally renowned musician who inspired generations but a South African patriot who instilled in us a pride of our Africanness,” Hatang said. Hatang said the reason he insisted that his children grow up speaking Setswana was because of Masekela’s teachings. “For Africans to take pride in who they are.” “Our thoughts are with his family, friends and comrades at these difficult times. May his soul rest in peace.” -TNA Reporter
