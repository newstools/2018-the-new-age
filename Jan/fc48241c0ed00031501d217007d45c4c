The Department of Higher Education and Training has called on matric students who passed their exams in 2017 but have not yet secured a place at a university or college to apply immediately using the department’s Central Application Clearing House system(CACH). CACH is an online application portal which was designed for Grade 12 students who are seeking admission to post-school training and education. It seeks to assist prospecting students by sharing their matric results with higher education institutions across the country. According to the department spokesperson Madikwe Mabotha, students who have been declined admission at tertiary institutions can still make use of the system. “Students who have been declined offers at universities should come to CACH, which is an ideal route to find a study space that is still available at another institution,” Mabotha said. “CACH also provides a portal for school leavers and other prospective students who may not have completed their schooling to career information, advice and development services.” He said the system had, in recent years, assisted thousands of young people across the country to find the right opportunities to access places available to get into training, college and universities. CACH website can be reached on cach.dhet.gov.za or call the toll-free number on 0800 356 635. Students can also send an SMS with their names and ID number to 49200 or to find CACH on Facebook: www.facebook.com/ CACH _S.A. The service is expected to start functioning from 5 January following the release of the 2017 matric results. It will close on 28 February 2018. -TNA Reporter
