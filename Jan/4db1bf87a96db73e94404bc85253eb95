The Department of Trade and Industries (Dti) has invited all Black Industrialists to participate in the trade mission that will take place between the 5th to the 9th of March, in Mozambique. The mission is part of the implementation of the Black Industrialists Programme that is aimed at promoting industrialisation, sustainable economic growth and transformation through the financial and non-financial support of black-owned entities in the manufacturing sector. Dti spokesperson Sidwell Medupe said they encourage companies in agro-processing, economic infrastructure and energy to apply by the 26th of January. “The mission is part of the department’s strategy to increase trade between South Africa and Mozambique. “The objective is to increase black industrialist’s trade with businesses in Mozambique. This is an ideal platform for the industrialists who would like to export value-added products and services,” Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies said. Companies that are willing to participate will be funded and will be screened according to the Black Industrialists Guidelines. -TNA Reporter
