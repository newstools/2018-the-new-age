The Equality Court in Durban will today hold a pre-trial hearing in a hate speech case against President Jacob Zuma’s son, Edward. The Human Rights Commission wants the court to find Zuma’s son guilty of hate speech and fined R100 000 for comments in his open letter to ANC NEC members Pravin Gordhan and Derek Hanekom. In the letter, Edward accused the pair of being “sellouts” and “stooges” who “brazenly and unabashedly” spoke out against his father on “various white monopoly media platforms.” He referred to Hanekom a “white monopoly capitalist offspring who is no better than a vile dog trained to maul a black skin.” Edward described Hanekom as an Askari, Gordhan as a sellout and one of the most corrupt cadres of the ANC who thinks that African natives are no better than just being sugar cane cutters who must be forever subservient to a master like him for sustenance. The commission said it was it was bringing the case in the public’s interest despite Edward apologising to Hanekom and Gordhan. Human Rights Commission spokesperson Gail Smith was unable to give an update on the case but said, as far as she knows, the case is scheduled for hearing today. “Yes the case is going to be heard today but I can’t give any comment because it is currently in court.” -TNA Reporter
