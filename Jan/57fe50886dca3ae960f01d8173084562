TV and radio personality Khanyi Mbau and long-time boyfriend Tebogo Lerole have called it quits. Mbau took to Instagram on Tuesday evening to confirm the breakup, where she penned a heartfelt message. She said: “When Love is not enough? WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?? Today. I made peace with a battle that I have lost, I have accepted defeat. My greatest fear and my greatest loss. letting go of the man I gave my heart too @edwardbillion it has taken so much from me in convincing my self that I am OKAY? Today I chose to face my fears and accept my truth. Today I let go of my greatest pain, LOVE IS PAIN .. for a while now I have been so insecure, so bitter and lonely, AS the wise WOULD say everything has a season!! THE HELL!!, WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?? My Summer has gone. My first ever experience of being truly in love and being fearless but the very same love has made so small and so sore inside. I have lost me .. today I let go of my future plans, the man I saw as the father of my kids and my future husband.. love of my life.. my best friend!! I am afraid, I am so afraid that I am going to learn how to love me genuinely first before I try and love again. Lord give me strength. #BROKEN #single #afraid #scared  ” With the couple spending the festive season together, no one saw the breakup coming, including their fans… Khanyi Mbau’s post took me back to a dark place.
