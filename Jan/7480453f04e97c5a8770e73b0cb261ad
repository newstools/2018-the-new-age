The ANC Youth League (ANCYL) was unperturbed following the rumour mill going into overdrive regarding president Jacob Zuma’s political future. While speaking to The New Age on Sunday, ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa was questioned about Zuma’s future amid increasing calls for his recall. Ramaphosa said: “Whatever we do, however we do it and whenever we do it, the ANC must be given time and space to deal with matters of this nature. We are not going to be doing anything that will seek to humiliate or disrespect the president.” Some took Ramaphosa’s statement as a clear indication that discussions to remove Zuma had been taking place, as he has been seen as a liability to the ANC in terms of support, given the cloud of corruption that follows him. Ramaphosa said people needed to be patient with regard to how the ANC dealt with Zuma as it was “a delicate matter”. ANCYL president Collen Maine said the ANCYL would wait and see how its mother body addressed the matter of Zuma’s removal. “We will wait for that Zuma removal discussion, because we have never discussed it in the organisation. So we will wait and see for the ANC to bring that discussion and only then will we state our case,” Maine said. Regarding the debate about the two centres of power with Zuma at the behest of the ANC leading the party in the government while Ramaphosa lead the party from its headquarters in Luthuli House, Johannesburg, Maine said he did not see any problem with that. Maine reiterated the sentiments of ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule by saying there were not two centres of power as the ANC remained a strategic centre of power. Ramaphosa answered the question of two centres of power by saying: “The ANC will always do the right thing by the people of South Africa, this would always guide whatever action the ANC took.” Refilwe Magashule refilwem@thenewage.co.za
