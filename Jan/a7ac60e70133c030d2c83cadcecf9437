Deputy Social Development Minister Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu at the weekend revealed she lost her brother in the Life Esidimeni tragedy. The deputy minister took to Facebook on Saturday to mourn the passing of her sister. She said: “What breaks my heart is that she is the elder sister of our brother who died [in the] Esidimeni tragedy.” Bogopane-Zulu said that her sister died on Friday morning after she was not treated at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital’s casualty ward. “I am very angry‚ our sister died yesterday morning after sitting the whole night at the casualty at Bara without being attended to‚ despite vomiting [and] having diarrhoea to the point of lying there unconscious till she died.” During the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings, it was found that at least 143 mentally ill patients died due to neglect or starvation when more than 1 700 patients were moved from Life Esidimeni to 27 unlicensed NGOs. Justice Dikgang Moseneke heard how 127 cases were currently being investigated despite the deaths of 143 patients, as a result of the Gauteng Mental Health Marathon Project. Major General Charles Johnson revealed that four deaths were already under investigation before the release of a report into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of 141 patients by Health Ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba. He said of the 127 cases currently under investigation, 38 were opened as inquests dockets while 89 were inquiries. Meanwhile, former Gauteng health MEC Qedani Mahlangu is set to appear before the arbitration to give her testimony from 22 to 26 January. -TNA Reporter
