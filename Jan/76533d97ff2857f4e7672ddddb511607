City of Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille says Cape Town has lost R1.6 billion in revenue because of reduced water consumption, making a “drought charge” to fund water supply projects more urgent. De Lille said drilling equipment is expected to arrive this week for water extraction to begin at the Cape Flats and Table Mountain aquifers. Water extraction from those areas follow reports of the availability of water at those locations. It is reported that the Cape Flats aquifer is expected to provide an extra 80 million litres per day, while the Table Mountain aquifer is expected to provide 40 million litres per day. “To help pay for the project, the city has proposed a ‘drought charge’ but this still has to be approved by Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba,” de Lille said. According to reports, 46 0216 households will be affected by drought charge while still waiting for the finance minister’s approval. If the drought charge is approved, it will affect 46 0216 households, with 52 510 paying more or less than R150 per month and the rest paying abound R47 per month. De Lille said the income would go towards making up for the water revenue lost through the diligent use of under 87 litres per person per day, by around 54% of residents. -TNA Reporter
