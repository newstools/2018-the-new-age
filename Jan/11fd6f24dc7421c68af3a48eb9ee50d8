Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula has on Wednesday announced that former Crime Intelligence boss Richard Mdluli has been relieved of his duties. “I wish to announce that Lt. Gen Richard Mdluli who held the position of Divisional Commissioner will be relieved of his duties. CI has seen 12 Acting Divisional Commissioners, this alarmed me greatly when I resumed my duties at the Police,” he said. Mbalula said during a briefing on the process of appointing a new head of the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI). However, in an exclusive interview with The New Age, Mduli, who has been earning a full salary since his suspension six years ago, refused to buckle under pressure to resign. “The SAPS has its rules, acts and processes on how it runs its affairs. When you are suspended, it does not mean you are fired. You are suspended in order to allow the investigation to carry on,” Mdluli said. “You don’t cook up allegations against me and use them because you want me to resign from my job. I won’t allow that. You don’t use false allegations against me and force me to resign. I’m not going to resign.” The charges against Mdluli relate to the 1999 kidnapping of Oupa Ramogibe, who reportedly had a love affair with Mdluli’s former lover, Tshidi Buthelezi.

The stability brought by the appointment of a permanent leader is essential if the unit is to add value in intelligence-driven policing,” said the Chairperson of the Committee, Mr Francois Beukman. -TNA Reporter
