US President Donald Trump’s participation at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland next week could be thrown into question now that the federal government has partially shut down over budget wrangling, the White House said Saturday. “We are taking Davos… on a day by day basis,” White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told journalists, without providing further details. The Trump adviser also confirmed the president would not head south to Florida this weekend as initially planned. The annual Davos meeting from January 23-26 brings together the world’s political and business leaders at a luxe Swiss ski resort for discussions of key global issues. The last US president to trek to Davos was Democrat Bill Clinton in 2000. -AFP
