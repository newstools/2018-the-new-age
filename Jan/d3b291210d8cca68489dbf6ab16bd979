A woman will appear in the Lehurutshe Magistrate’s Court on Monday in connection with the attempted murder of her newborn baby. The 21-year-old woman was arrested on Saturday for allegedly attempting to kill the baby boy. Lieutenant-Colonel Amanda Funani said: “It appears that the woman, whom the family did not know was pregnant, delivered a baby boy without the assistance of any person and then threw the newborn into a pit toilet in Dinokana village, Lehurutshe.” “The baby was discovered by the woman’s cousin after she saw blood on the toilet floor. While still shocked, she heard the baby crying from the pit toilet and called her sister and the neighbours.” The mother and baby were taken to hospital for medical examination. North West police commissioner Lieutenant-General Baile Motswenyane has condemned the incident and commended the police and Emergency Services personnel for working together to preserve life by removing the baby, alive, from the pit toilet. -TNA Reporter
