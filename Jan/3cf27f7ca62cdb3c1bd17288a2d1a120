The Wits University has announced that it has finalised applications for the 2018 academic year and will not be accepting any further applications for the first-semester intake. The announcement comes after the EFF called on everyone in possession of a Grade 12 to demand free education. EFF leader Julius Malema called on all South Africans who are in possession of a grade 12 certificate but doing menial jobs to go to any university of their choice to demand free education as promised by President Jacob Zuma in December. On Tuesday, the association representing universities in South Africa said that no walk-in students would be accepted at all 26 universities in South Africa. President Zuma had announced that free education would be provided for poor students at both universities and FET colleges. Wits University said the closing date for undergraduate studies at the University was the 30 September 2017, therefore it is impossible to accept any more students. The university’s Spokesperson Schalk Mouton said they received more applications than they can accommodate. “Wits University has received 56 901 applications for first-year enrolments for the 2018 academic year and has a place for only 5 664 first-year students.” He said the University has the capacity to enroll a maximum of 36 400 full-time students. Wits University Registrar Carol Crosley says the university has doubled its enrolment capacity in the last 20 years and warned against over enrolment. “Over enrolment has a significant impact on the academic integrity of the University’s academic programme. It stretches the University’s human resources capacity and impacts on infrastructure as the University only has a defined number of teaching venues,” Crosley said. -TNA Reporter
