A DRIVER, who was arrested after driving at 231km/h in a 120km/h zone, will appear in the Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court today. He was arrested in his Audi A3 on the N4 in Alkmaar. The authorities said more than 550 crashes were recorded in the province since December 1. The province has also recorded 111 fatalities on its roads so far. Community safety, security and liaison spokesperson Joseph Mabuza confirmed the incident. “It is true that the driver was arrested and taken to the Nelspruit police station,” Mabuza said. “He will be appearing in court today. We are appealing to motorists not to exceed the speed limit as they are placing other people’s lives in danger. “The police in the province will not tolerate such behaviour and those found speeding will be immediately arrested,” Mabuza said. He urged motorists to also respect the rules of the road. He said most of the crashes resulted from head-on collisions, side collisions, loss of control and illegal overtaking among others. He encouraged community members to report bad driving to the authorities to avert accidents on the road. Last month, Mamelodi Sundowns senior administrator Alex Shakwane was arrested for allegedly speeding in the province. Meanwhile, the department released the statistics on the number of offences committed by motorists during the festive season. The statistics said 129947 vehicles were stopped by traffic officers, 21190 summonses were issued, 619 arrests were made, 431 drunk driving cases were recorded, 177 drivers were caught speeding, false documents and other related crimes were recorded. -Masoka Dube
