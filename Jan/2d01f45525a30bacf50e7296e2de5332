The SACP in Gauteng has expressed concern following a ruling by the North Gauteng High Court on Monday set aside an instruction by the Gauteng education department for Hoerskool Overvaal to register 55 more Grade 8 pupils. The party said it is deeply concerned by the ruling as it contradicts the efforts by the democratic government to transform the education system for the benefit of the majority of the country’s pupils. Gauteng SACP provincial secretary Jacob Mamabolo said the party would like to congratulate Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi for his relentless struggle for the transformation and access to education in the province. “We also encourage the department to continue waging the struggle to its logical conclusion. This includes the struggle for the teaching of progressive ideas throughout our education system,” Mamabolo said. He said the SACP in Gauteng had pledged its full support and solidarity to the department, Lesufi and the parents of the affected children. Mamabolo said the party would be mobilising for mass protest action until what he called blatant acts of racism were completely rooted out in the education system. -TNA Reporter
