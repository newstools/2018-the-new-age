A judge in the South Gauteng High Court judge has asked the SANDF why it went against a court order and evicted residents of Marievale without providing alternative accommodation. Marievale residents took the issue to court after they were evicted from an old SANDF base despite being in possession of a court order preventing the Defence Force from removing them in November. More than 600 residents were removed after coal was reportedly discovered in the area. Civil society group Right 2 Know has said it is confident the court will rule in the residents’ favour. Organisation spokesperson Moeketsi Monaheng said it was high time that SANDF stopped acting above the law. “The judge was very much unhappy with their soldiers’ conduct and he kept asking why they went against the law,” Monaheng said. Monaheng said the SANDF’s actions were illegal and those who took the decision to remove the residents should be held accountable. Judgment in the case is expected to be handed down on Friday. -TNA Reporter
