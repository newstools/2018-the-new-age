A TWO-YEAR-OLD boy whose penis was mutilated with a pair of scissors allegedly by his mother’s boyfriend is fighting for his life in the Red Cross Children Hospital in Cape Town. The boy sustained a severe wound, according to the police. The gruesome incident took place at a house in Bontebok Street in Rosemore, George last week. The suspect has since been arrested and is expected to appear in court this week. Yesterday, angry community members demanded that the 33-year-old suspect be handed a stiff jail sentence. The little boy is now being treated at the Red Cross Children’s Hospital. It is believed that the boy’s mother had an argument with her boyfriend before the attack on her son. According to Southern Cape police spokesperson Capt Malcolm Pojie the boy was sleeping with his mother when he was attacked. Pojie said that the suspect, who tried to run away after the incident, was arrested minutes later and a bloodstained pair of scissors was found at the crime scene. “The 33-year-old suspect is facing a charge of attempted murder,” he said. Neighbourhood Watch member Colin Dunster demanded that the culprit remain behind bars for the rest of his life. “On behalf of the innocent child we as community members demand justice be served and we wish this man to remain behind bars until he is sentenced.’’ Another resident, Alfred Booysen of Rosemore, said: “We are very angry that this brutal attack has happened to an innocent child. Imagine all the pain he is now going through. This is a scar for life.” Eden cluster commander Maj Gen Oswald Reddy and Conville police station commander Col Avril Kriga both condemned the act as barbaric. -MPUMI KIVA|news@thenewage.co.za
