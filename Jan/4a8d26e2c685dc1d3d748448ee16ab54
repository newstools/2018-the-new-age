A police officer, 42, arrested by the Hawks for allegedly demanding a bribe from a suspect will appear in the Seshego Magistrate’s Court near Polokwane on corruption charges today. Hawks provincial spokesperson Capt Matimba Maluleke said the detective sergeant was arrested in a trap operation on Friday after allegedly receiving R1000 from an individual believed to have caused a road accident. “The detective attached to the Seshego police station demanded a bribe from a suspect arrested for a hit-and-run road accident in order to expedite his bail process,” Maluleke said. “After the Hawks were alerted they immediately set up a trap that culminated in the arrest of the officer at his home after he received the bribe.” The arrest of the detective came a week after another police officer at the nearby Westernburg police station was sentenced to life imprisonment and a further 15-years’ jail term for murder and robbery by the Thohoyandou High Court. Const Kulani Obert Manganyi, 34, was off duty and in the company of an accomplice when he shot and killed a spaza shop owner, Abdulah Hassan Omar, at Hlanganani RDP section on the night of February 24, 2014. After the murder, the duo then stole R3000 from the shop and fled the scene on foot, police said. Police commissioner Lt-Gen Nneke Ledwaba said: “Evidence which was collected from the scene of this crime and the resultant forensic investigation led to the arrest of Manganyi. “His service firearm was linked to the murder through ballistic examination,“ police said. “We will always be merciless and ruthless when confronting acts of criminality regardless of which quarter they emanate,” Ledwaba said.
