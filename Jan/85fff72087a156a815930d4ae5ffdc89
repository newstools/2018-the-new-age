The Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL Rights Commission) says it is looking forward to judgment in a case against controversial “prophet” Rabalago Lethebo, which will be handed down on 31 January, for his part in the usage of insecticide on his congregants. In March last year, the Limpopo High Court ordered that Lethebo stop using insecticide on churchgoers. The commission has said the court outcome will probably vindicate what it has always said, that there are a number of religious leaders who violate the dignity of people and in the process, abuse their belief systems. “We have also repeatedly said that there aren’t enough laws, unless and until the victims stand up against these abuses,” the commission said in a statement. Lethebo, also known as the “Prophet of Doom,” first made headlines when a video circulated on social media showing him spraying Doom on his congregants, to heal them. According to reports, Lethebo said he used Doom to heal people suffering from diseases like cancer and HIV. Meanwhile, CRL Rights Commission Chairperson Thoko Mkhwanazi Xaluva said she hoped the judgment would be appropriate enough and thereby send a clear and strong warning to all those pastors or prophets who take advantage of the poor, vulnerable and desperate people. “The commission wishes to applaud the victims who have stood up for their rights to dignity and safety.” -TNA Reporter
