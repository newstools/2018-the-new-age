Two Tshwane Metro Police officers are expected to appear in the Pretoria Commercial Crimes Court on Wednesday on charges of kidnapping, robbery, extortion, defeating the ends of justice and corruption. Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) spokesperson Simon Zwane said the two were arrested on Monday when they reported for duty at the Lyttelton police station. “The officers were investigated following allegations that they had taken a motorist to the bank to withdraw bribe money,” Zwane said. The arrest was carried out by a collaborative team compromising of members of the RTMC’s National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit, the South African Police Service’s Organised Crime Unit, the Tshwane Metro Police Internal Affairs Unit and the Gauteng Traffic Police Compliance Unit. “We believe that one of the suspects is a new recruit who completed training last year.” -TNA Reporter
