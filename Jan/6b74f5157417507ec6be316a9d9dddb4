Thousands of prospective Capricorn Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) students arrived at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on Monday morning to continue with registration for the 2018 academic year after the process was suspended last week due to a stampeded in which several people were injured. Four people had to be treated in hospital and were later released after they were injured in the stampede while two others were hit by a car. The driver of the car is still being sought by police officials. Deputy Higher Education and Training Minister Buti Manamela is expected to visit the registration venue and several higher education institutions in Limpopo on Monday. Manamela: “I urge students to cooperate with the staff and management of the institution so that we conclude the registration process quickly. Manamela will visit the University of Limpopo and the Tshwane University of Technology’s Polokwane campus to assess the registration process. Meanwhile, the deputy minister has urged political parties not to prey on the anxiety of poor and working-class young people whose only interest is to access free education. It is widely believed that the larger numbers of students are a result of the EFF’s call for those in possession of a Grade 12 certificate to go to any higher education institution do demand free education, as promised by President Jacob Zuma. At the same time, some students in other parts of Limpopo have taken to social media to announce that they have heeded the EFF’s call and invaded institutions to register for the courses of their choice. I was the first person to register for free at CS Barlow Sekhukhune tvet college because EFF intervened and propelled the ignorant and arrogant principal of the institution to implement free registrations,Thanks to my EFF provincial leadership and the EFFSC of Cs Barlow campus — Probe the Zuptas (@vknative) January 14, 2018 In December, Zuma announced that the government would be providing free tertiary education to qualifying students. Despite the throngs of students arriving to register, college management has announced it can only accept 1 200 new students. -TNA Reporter
