DA Shadow Minister of Public Enterprises Natasha Mazzone says the party welcomes the ‘long overdue’ resignation of Eskom’s Chairperson Zethemba Khoza. “However, this does not absolve him from the role he played in Eskom’s decline and we will not allow him or anyone implicated in corruption at state-owned enterprises to escape the consequences.” Mazzone says that it is important that there are no delays in appointing new Chairperson and CEO of the energy utility. “Khoza’s resignation and the leadership vacuum at Eskom once again shows Minister Lynne Brown’s complete inability to manage our SOEs. “The appointment of suitable and capable Chairperson and CEO is only the first step in helping Eskom recover from the chronic mismanagement and looting which has brought the parastatal to the brink of collapse.” Khoza was appointed the chairperson of Eskom board in June 2017, following Dr Ben Ngubane’s resignation. According to reports, Khoza confirmed that he submitted his resignation letter to the Minister of Public Enterprises Lynne Brown and is waiting for her response. He said he “thinks his actions are in the good of the country, and after all the noise it is better for him to resign”. -TNA Reporter
