Nontombi Gwam, the mother of the three-year-old Latoya who died in an ambulance on the way from prophet Paseka (Mboro) Motsoeneng’s church on December 24 will speak for the first time today since the incident happened. Gwam will update the media along with prophet Mboro about the case she’s opened relating to the death of her child as well as the grievous bodily harm charge she laid against Emergency Management Services. Meanwhile, the city of Ekurhuleni has launched an investigation into the matter so that corrective action can be taken. “The city views this matter seriously and is working with law enforcement in unravelling it. The ward councillor under which the Gwam family falls in Daveyton and other municipal officials are constantly visiting and engaging with the family, assisting them with all relevant logistics for the recent funeral of the little girl,” Ekurhuleni’s William Ntladi said. The controversial pastor previously opened a case of common assault against an Ekurhuleni Emergency Services female paramedic and it will be heard in court this month. This follows an alleged altercation at his Incredible Happenings church in Katlehong last week Sunday, where Mboro allegedly assaulted the driver of an ambulance who was called out to attend to the toddler who collapsed at his church. Gwam also opened a case of culpable homicide against the paramedics. Gwam said in a statement that she turned to the church after nurses at the Daveyton Clinic turned her away claiming they didn’t have drips for the child who had diarrhoea. She said she could not go to the hospital because she did not get a referral letter from the clinic’s nurses. Police have been given 14 days to bring the case against Motsoeneng to court. The police’s Lesetja Mathobela said Mboro was arrested last week Wednesday and is out on a warning since the charge against him is common assault. dikeledim@thenewage.co.za
