AS SCHOOLS reopen, the Gauteng department of education is still yet to place 28 435 pupils at schools. MEC Panyaza Lesufi yesterday said that 2 565 of 31000 pupils were placed at the weekend. Lesufi said the department was ready to start the first day of school and said they would be done with placements by mid-February. “The 2 565 applicants have accepted their offer but the remaining applicants are still resisting. Notwithstanding our efforts to get all parents to apply on time so that we can improve on our planning processes, a total of 4 500 new applications have been received since Saturday,” Lesufi said. He said the department faced a major challenge from parents who didn’t want to understand that certain schools of their choice are full. He said space for applicants was not a problem but parents of pupils who refuse to accept offers of the recommended schools. Lesufi said the number of new applicants was expected to increase as parents continued to visit admission centres and unplanned financial implications of admitting late applicants were substantial. “To all the new applicants, we will place every child who has applied, however, it may not be at your school of choice. Additional funding will have to be found to finance teacher salaries, additional classrooms, learning and teaching support materials and school furniture,” Lesufi said. He urged parents who still have admission queries to visit admission centres and said they would operate until end of this month. Meanwhile, as an intervention process, Lesufi will today meet with some of the schools which had urgent matters last year. On Lesufi’s list is the controversial Klipspruit West Secondary School which had disruptions last year and performed poorly in their 2017 matric results. Lesufi said given the historical performance of the school, the department was considering the option of re-establishing the school. -SHONISANI TSHIKALANGE|shonisanit@thenewage.co.za
