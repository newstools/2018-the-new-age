The DA says the EFF leadership must be held accountable for inciting its members to trash stores. The party was speaking after acts of vandalism at took place H&M stores in Sandton‚ Menlyn Park and on the East Rand by members of the red berets on Saturday,. The vandalism follows last week’s image of a black child wearing an H&M sweater with “coolest monkey in the zoo” written across it. DA National Spokesperson Refiloe Nt’sekhe said, there are other effective and non-violent ways to fight institutional racism and the destruction of property doesn’t even begin to solve the problem. EFF Leader Julius Malema and other EFF members have since taken to Twitter to support their members’ actions and issued a stern warning to all racists. Meanwhile, Nt’sekhe said Malema must be made to pay for all the damages incurred, to compensate the employees who had to put in more hours clearing the mess at H&M stores. “The trashing of stores cannot be condoned as it does not begin to topple the real elephant in the room, racism,” Nt’sekhe said. She said this clearly showed that the EFF was not genuine in its solidarity with the employees who now might face possible job losses in a country that grappling with high rates of unemployment. -TNA Reporter
