A number of student groups under the Progressive Youth Alliance (PYA) have threatened to shut down the registration processes if Durban University of Technology (DUT) management does not change its registration fee policy. Students, together with members from the South African Student Congress (Sasco), Young Communist League (YCL) and ANC Youth League (ANCYL) reportedly gathered at DUT to protest against the university’s demand for registration fees from all students. The students have quoted the media statement from the Department of Higher Education and Training which says students do not need to pay a registration fee upfront, as the department will make a deal with universities and NSFAS to cover the registration fee. According to reports, Sasco secretary Thabo Sukanazo Tsheme said registration fees are considered a burden for students assisted by NSFAS. “No student should be excluded from an opportunity to study because of registration fees, we are going to make sure that registration stops for everyone, not just the poor.” -TNA Reporter
