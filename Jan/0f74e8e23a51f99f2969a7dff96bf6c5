DA leader Mmusi Maimane says the city of Cape Town has managed to push back Day Zero by four days. It has now moved from 12 April to 16 April. Maimane made the announcement at a press briefing on Tuesday. Last week, the city announced that 580 million litres were consumed per week, bringing forward Day Zero which is believed is the day taps will run dry. “Over the past few days, consumption has dropped from the 580 million average to 540 million litres per day. This is great progress but to truly defeat Day Zero, we need to aim to cut consumption to 450 million litres a day,” Maimane said. Maimane said while this was good news, he was still calling on residents to support the campaign to defeat Day Zero by cutting their consumption to below 50 litres per person per day. He said the city managed to secure 67 million litres of water per day for 60 days from February from the Palmiet dam. Meanwhile, relief organisation Gift of the Givers has announced it will be joining the fight against Day Zero. The organisation announced that it would be handing out five litres of water to residents of Cape Town, starting on Tuesday. -TNA Reporter
