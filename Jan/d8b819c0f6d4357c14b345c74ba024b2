The Public Protector has referred all the matters which could be considered under the umbrella term of ‘state capture’ to the properly resourced and funded judicial commision of inquiry, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane said in a statement on Thursday. The allegations, some of which were referred to her office following the publication of the Gupta Leaks are the basis of what she would like to be investigated in the inquiry. She says that her statement of January 10 was misinterpreted. “The publication of the statement was intended to suggest that all related allegations of state capture are investigated by the commission and that the commission’s work is not limited to those identified for investigation in the state of capture report,” she said. Among the new allegations – not included in the original State of Capture report – she would like to see investigated are: Like the previous Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, Mkhwebane said she was referring these new matters to the inquiry because of a lack of funds and resources within her own office. – TNA Reporter
