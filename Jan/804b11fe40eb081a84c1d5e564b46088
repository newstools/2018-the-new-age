THE provincial government has called for an investigation into the actions of the police and emergency services in Tarlton, west of Johannesburg in the aftermath of the death of farm worker Aaron Mutavhatsimbi, 43. The killing was allegedly by a white security guard at Matshelapata informal settlement on Saturday. Eyewitnesses complained about the conduct of the police and claim that an officer turned away an ambulance which was on its way to assist the victim because it was “unsafe”. Family members were forced to take him by car to the police station where the ambulance was parked but he died before he arrived. “It seems like an officer prevented an ambulance from going to the scene because in his/her view, the place was not safe,” Gautend economic development, environment, agriculture and rural development MEC Lebogang Maile said yesterday during a visit to the deceased’s home and the local police station. “Whatever the reason, the killing is not justifiable. It remains disgusting, senseless and we condemn it. We will make sure that justice is served,” Maile said. He said that in the next two weeks, he would meet with farmers to discuss various issues like farm worker killings and ways to assist them business-wise. The deceased’s nephew, Ebrahim Ramashia, was present when his uncle took his last breath. “I noticed my uncle driving a tractor towards the community and that he was being pursued by two vehicles. “I saw the security guard sticking his hand out of his window and shooting at my uncle. He then lost control of the tractor and hit a tree,” Ramashia said. He said the family just wanted justice to be served. Mutavhatsimbi’s body was transported from the Roodepoort mortuary to his home in Vuwani, Venda. “The Gauteng provincial government will contribute towards the funeral to ensure that Mutavhatsimbi gets a fitting send-off,” Maile said.  -NTOMBI NKOSI|ntombin@thenewage.co.za
