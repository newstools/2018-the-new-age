What a way to start the new year! South African rap sensation Cassper Nyovest has bagged his first award for 2018, walking away with the Best Hip Hop award at the Sound City MVP Awards. The Sound City MVP Awards were held at the Eko Convention Centre, Victoria Island in Lagos on Saturday. Nyovest took to social media to express his appreciation, saying the award gave him hope for South African hip hop and African hip-hop as a whole. I can’t express how much I appreciate this award. It gives me hope for SA hip hop and African hip hop as a whole. It says “keep going, you’ve got the right direction.” A Tswana Boy from Mafikeng did that!!!Shout out to the African Hip Hop fans!!All the glory to God. #SoundCityMvp pic.twitter.com/gr1lO5gNSl — R.M Phoolo (@CassperNyovest) January 13, 2018 BOOM!!!
