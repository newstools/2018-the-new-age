Deputy Higher Education and Training Minister Buti Manamela on Friday shut down two colleges in Johannesburg that were allegedly operating illegally. Manamela, during his nationwide public awareness campaign, aimed at enforcing compliance with the relevant legislation in the private college sector, ordered that Johannesburg City College shut down with immediate effect, as it was not registered to offer any higher learning programmes.

The deputy minister urged parents and students, who prefer private colleges, to inquire first whether they are registered and find out about what programmes are being offered. “Some of the colleges that we will be visiting today, we have found out that they have registered as colleges but they have not registered the programmes that they are offering. So when those kids graduate and get certificates and when they go to the market, they only find out then that the certificate that they obtained is not recognised.” Manamela also found that Sandton Technical College is currently running illegally, after inspecting its documents.
