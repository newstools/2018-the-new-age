Durban Regional Court Magistrate Anand Maharaj on Wednesday ordered an immediate assessment of the living conditions of baby Siwaphiwe and her three other siblings, who will remain in the care their father after their mother was sentenced to a five-year jail term. Baby Siwaphiwe made headlines last year after she was reported missing in what turned out to be a fake hijacking. Sibongile Mbambo was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of fraud and defeating the ends of justice. The little girl was returned to Mbambo’s care in December after spending nine months in crisis care. Social workers have reportedly been ordered to assess the well-being of Mbambo’s children, including baby Siwaphiwe. In addition, social workers will conduct monthly assessments to ensure that the children are well taken care of. -TNA Reporter
