Caroline Wozniacki saved two match points to scrape through to the third round of the Australian Open on Wednesday after being 5-1 down in the final set to unheralded Jana Fett. The Danish number two seed somehow prevailed after a titanic struggle 3-6, 6-2, 7-5 against the world number 119 on a searing Rod Laver Arena in two hours and 31 minutes. She next faces either Kiki Bertens of the Netherlands or American Nicole Gibbs for a place in the last 16. -AFP
