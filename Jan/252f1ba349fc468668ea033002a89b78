The University of South Africa (Unisa) has decided to extend its deadline for applications until the close of business on Tuesday, 23 January. “Unisa has decided to extend applications to Tuesday 23 January and registrations to Tuesday 30 January. This will allow the university to process all applications before registrations close. We continue to encourage all applicants and students to apply and register online,” Unisa said in a Twitter post. Registration for new students remains suspended following a strike by National Education Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) members. Nehawu said its members would not return to work until all of their demands were met by university management. Among the demands, Nehawu wants a 12% salary increase across the board, all council members to stop doing business with the university, all council members implicated in the state of the capture probe to resign from the council with immediate effect and that the university absorbs all contract workers with immediate effect. Unisa had resumed the registration process after disruptions on Monday. University spokesperson Martin Ramotshela said it was hoped Unisa management and Nehawu would find each other soon. Ramotshela said Unisa management had increased its salary offer to 7% after initially offering 6.5%. -TNA Reporter
