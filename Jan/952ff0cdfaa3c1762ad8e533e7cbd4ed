PROTEAS new kid on the block Lungi Ngidi has explained how fellow fast bowler Kagiso Rabada helped him settle his nerves during his Test debut against India at SuperSport Park in Centurion. Ngidi introduced himself in style by taking seven wickets to help South Africa to a 135-run victory and to clinch the series 2-0 with a match to spare. It has always been a dream for Ngidi to play alongside Rabada for the Proteas and he said that the top-ranked Test bowler helped him throughout. “It has been a dream come true for me to be able to bowl alongside him. It has been a dream of mine and just to make a Test debut and having him in the other end, he actually has a lot of knowledge,” Ngidi said. “He is No 1 in the world, we have been chatting throughout the innings. He gave me ideas here and there and to see them work out really shows he is a world class bowler.” Ngidi, who received a standing ovation from the Centurion crowd following his impressive outing and after taking the big wicket of India captain Virat Kohli before stumps on day four, said he will cherish that wicket. “The one I enjoyed I think is the captain’s wicket. Those are very special moments. “I worked hard and I figured out a game plan in terms of bowling at him. So finally getting him really meant a lot to me.” At 21 there is no doubt that the future looks bright for Ngidi. “To be honest it is actually difficult to describe, it is not something I’m used to. It really hit me, you get goose bumps and nervous and that time you are in the middle of the game. “But it it’s an honour to have people appreciate the work that you are doing out there. It’s hard to describe but it is a blessing.” -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
