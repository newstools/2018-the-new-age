President Jacob Zuma has declared a Special Official Funeral for the late author, poet and Liberation Struggle Stalward Professor William Keorapetse Kgositsile. Kgositsile will be afforded a funeral for distinguished persons specifically designated by the President following his death on Wednesday last week after a long illness. In 2006, Kgositsile was honoured as South Africa’s second National Poet Laureate after the Professor Mazisi Kunene was awarded the inaugural award. He was also a recipient of the National Order of Ikhamanga for his contribution to the field of literature and arts. Zuma also ordered that the South African flag be flown at half-mast at every flag station in the country on Tuesday 16 January, the day Kgositsile will be buried. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver Kgositsile’s eulogy at the funeral. Kgositsile’s memorial services are expected to be held at several areas around the world including New York where he lived for 13 years. His official memorial will, however, be held at the city hall on the 11 January from 12 to 16 PM. -TNA Reporter
