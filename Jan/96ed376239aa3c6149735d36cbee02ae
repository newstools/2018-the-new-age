The Presidency has denied that President Jacob Zuma and ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa met to discuss the appointment of Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma as deputy president of South Africa. The Presidency in a statement on Sunday said the two leaders met to discuss several issues and updated each other on matters in both the government and the governing party. Presidency spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga said Zuma briefed Ramaphosa on his plans to institute a commission of inquiry into state capture. Ngqulunga said the president and his deputy resolved to hold regular meetings in order to ensure synergy between the governing party and government since Zuma is no longer a member of the ANC top six. “It would enable the deputy president to keep the head of state and government abreast of issues discussed by the leadership of the governing party.” He said Zuma and Ramaphosa meet in Cabinet committee meetings on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays every week, except during recess while Cabinet meets fortnightly, on Wednesdays. -TNA Reporter
