D-day is looming for pupils who wish to register for supplementary examinations, with today being the last day for registration. The Department of Basic Education urged pupils who still need to register for the examinations to do so at the nearest district education office. “Supplementary examinations form part of the department’s Second Chance programme and affords candidates who have not met the minimum promotion and certification requirements, but who require a maximum of two subjects to obtain a National Senior Certificate (NSC), the opportunity to do so. “We reiterate that candidates wishing to register for these examinations have until today to register at the examination centre where they sat to write the 2017 NSC examinations,” department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said. He said the opportunity to write supplementary examinations was also extended to candidates who could not sit or finish examinations due to various reasons including medical, a death in the family, or some other special reason, provided documentary evidence is provided. “Application forms for re-checking or re-marking of examination answer scripts are available from schools or examination centres. “A cost of R23 is applicable for re-checking, R98 for re-marking and R192 for viewing of an examination script.” Mhlanga said a supplementary examination timetable and support material had been made available on the department website. shonisanit@thenewage.co.za
