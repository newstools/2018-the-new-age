On day two of the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) inquiry, Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini stuck to her guns that work streams team was initiated to work hand-in-hand with Sassa officials. The minister on Tuesday continued to give testimony at the inquiry as to why she should not be liable for cost of litigation following a 2015 ruling by the Constitutional Court that Sassa awarding Cash Paymaster Service (CPS) a contract had been irregular and declared invalid. Dlamini said that it was not fair to label the work streams as being her initiative. She said they should rather be seen as Sassa’s project, since the work streams worked with Sassa officials. “The work streams aim was to work closely with Sassa and the whole idea of the work streams was adopted by the executives,” Dlamini said. However, on Monday, Dlamini said that the work stream leaders reported directly to her. The inquiry is headed by Judge Bernard Ngoepe and will continue untill Friday. regom@thenewage.co.za
