A 66-year-old KwaZulu-Natal farmer will make his second court appearance on 9 January after his case was postponed earlier today. Edward Solomon appeared in the New Hanover Magistrate’s Court to face a charge of murder after he allegedly shot dead mourner Mothi Ngubane during a funeral held at his farm in Cramond near Pietermaritzburg. According to reports, Solomon got into an argument with mourners when they wanted to bury Njabulo Lembethe on his farm. Lembethe had been living on the farm for several years. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Nqobile Gwala said the suspect arrived at the scene and told mourners to leave the premises. “The 66-year-old suspect showed up and asked all the people who were at the funeral to leave the premises.” Gwala said 42-year-old Ngubane had an argument with Solomon when he allegedly pulled out a gun and shot him. “The farmer allegedly shot the 42-year-old victim and he died at the scene due to the injuries sustained.” The suspect fled the scene in his vehicle and the Cramond police were called to the scene and managed to apprehend the suspect who was found in possession of four firearms. According to Gwala, after the shooting, Solomon fled the scene in his car, but was later arrested. -TNA Reporter
