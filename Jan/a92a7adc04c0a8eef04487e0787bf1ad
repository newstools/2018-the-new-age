Automobile Association (AA) has announced that fuel prices will decrease in January month-end. This comes after a mid-month fuel price data which was released by the Central Energy Fund. “The Rand/US dollar exchange rate has had one of its flattest periods of trading in recent times. It has traded in a very narrow band between R12.30 and R12.40 to the US currency since the last week of December, bringing some welcome stability,” AA said. AA also indicated that the international prices of petrol and diesel were also stable over the same period, although there was a slight climb in both in the second week of January. “The current data predicts a decrease in petrol of nearly 41 cents a litre, with diesel down by 23 cents and illuminating paraffin dropping 26 cents.” It added that the continued stability in fuel prices for 2018 will largely depend on political and economic factors which affect South Africa’s attractiveness as an investment destination. -TNA Reporter
