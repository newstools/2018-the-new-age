THE Ekurhuleni central cluster community policing forum (CPF) has vowed to petition entities that are not addressing or giving adequate attention to the problem of illegal mining in Benoni in a bid to spur them into taking action. This is after the bodies of seven suspected illegal miners were found in the veld near a mine shaft in Benoni last week. It is suspected that they had been shot and killed elsewhere and the bodies later dumped. Maj-Gen Poobalan Subbiah, the commander of the SAPS Ekurhuleni central cluster, said a member of the public informed the police about the bodies at 7.30am. The commander said this came after the police received reports the day before that miners had been shot underground but their inspection of open shafts in the cluster did not unearth any bodies. Reza Patel, executive chairperson of the Ekurhuleni central cluster CPF, said all stakeholders needed to work together to fight the problem. “There does not seem to be a concerted effort to bring about an end to this problem. There is not enough will or effort to resolve the issue,” Patel said. In November, four illegal miners were killed and 15 others arrested after a shoot-out with police in Boksburg. “The DA tabled a motion in the Gauteng provincial legislature proposing the police restore the specialised units which focus on illegal mining in Gauteng,” Michelle Clarke, DA Gauteng spokesperson for community safety, said. The motion was rejected by the ANC majority in the house, the DA said. Police spokesperson Capt Nomsa Sekele said the police undertake operations targeting illegal mining and these usually result in the seizure of illegal mining equipment and sometimes also arrests. province@thenewage.co.za
