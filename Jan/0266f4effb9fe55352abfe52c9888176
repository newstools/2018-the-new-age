Task team police in KwaZulu-Natal have asked for help in their search for a suspect who they believe was involved in an attempted murder case at the Glebelands Hostel in Durban. It’s alleged Bongani Mbhele, 34, shot and injured a 32-year-old man who was a member of the hostel peace committee in Block 52 while he was going to fetch water on 30 September 2016. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said Mbhele allegedly hid  and waited for the victim on a corner and when the victim walked past, fired several shots, wounding him in the face. “The victim, who stayed at the hostel, recognised Mbhele and ran for his life. He was later taken to hospital for medical attention,” Zwane said. Zwane said a case of attempted murder was opened at the Umlazi police station for investigation but added that the motive for the attack was not yet known. Mbhele is also being sought in connection with other murder and attempted murder cases. Zwane said Mbele is known to be armed and dangerous. Anyone able to assist the police with his whereabouts has been urged to contact investigating Warrant Officer Bonginkosi Ngcobo on 079 5000 694 or 083 477 6690. They can also contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211. -TNA Reporter
