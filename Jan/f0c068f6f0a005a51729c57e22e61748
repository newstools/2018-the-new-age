Orlando Pirates defender Ayanda Gcaba has joined Platinum Stars on a loan for the remainder of the season. Dikwena and Pirates agreed on the service of Gcaba as the club is trying to fight to survive a relegation zone. The Buccaneers said, “Orlando Pirates Football Club has reached an agreement with Platinum Stars over the services of defender Ayanda Gcaba. The defender moves to Dikwena on loan for the remainder of the season.” Gcaba has been at the club since 2012 having signed from Free State Stars. The 31-year-old had been a regular starter in the Buccaneers setup until recently where he has had little game-time this season under Micho Sredojevic. -TNA Reporter
