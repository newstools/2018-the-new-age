The Basic Education Department has condemned the use of initiation practices in schools. “Initiation is prohibited in our schools and any pupil who is subjected to such
practices are encouraged to report it to their parents immediately,” department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said. The department said initiation practices were are often violent and humiliating for pupils and constitute a form of abuse. “Initiation practices breed a culture of violence. This is not welcome in the schooling
environment and may cause pupils who feel intimidated and humiliated to act out
violently in retaliation.” “Schools need to be peaceful and safe spaces that are welcoming and conducive to impactful learning, not a place of fear.” -TNA Reporter
