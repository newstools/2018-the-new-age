The North Gauteng High Court will on Thursday rule on the legality of a decision to pay former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe a R30.1 million pension payout. The case was brought forward by trade union Solidarity. Head of Solidarity’s Centre for Fair Labour Practices Anton van der Bijl said Molefe’s initial early retirement and the subsequent pension payout were neither lawful nor within the framework of Eskom’s pension and provident fund. “Molefe acted unlawfully and in no way within the framework of Eskom’s pension and provident fund and that is why it would please us if the court rules that Molefe is to be held liable for it in his personal capacity,” van der Bijl said. During the court case in November, the court heard that the parastatal’s board had decided to give Molefe a pension payout of R30.1 million. Molefe left Eskom after he was fingered by former public protector Thuli Madonsela as a key player in the capturing of the company in her State of Capture report but later returned to the company after Minister of Public Enterprise Lynn Brown refused to grant his request for a R30 million pension payout. -TNA Reporter
