Some protesters attempted to set up barricades outside the Afrikaans-medium school which has been hit by accusations of racism after it refused to admit 55 English-speaking pupils. The police separated the parents and the protesters for fear of violent clashes as experienced on the first day of the protest. One of the protesters said that they were not at the school to tamper with the education of the kids. Meanwhile, Cosas has vowed to shut down the school if it does not admit the leaners. Provincial Chairperson Wandile Mofokeng said: “We want those 55 learners being placed in this school regardless of their language. We are going to shut down this school, there is no one who going to enter now, there is no one who is going to come out. “We want to shut down this school until the MEC of education disbands this SGB and appoints an interim administration that will be in charge of the school that is not racist.” Over 10 people arrested yet again after a police car was set on fire @ANN7tv #Hoërskoolovervaal pic.twitter.com/L14DPbTXfl — sindisiwe twala (@TwalaSindisiwe) January 18, 2018 Violence has erupted again outside #HoërskoolOvervaal with shots having been fired after protestors tried to set a police car alight.
