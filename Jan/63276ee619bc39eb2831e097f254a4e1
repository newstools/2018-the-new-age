Tensions continued to flare at the Hoërskool Overvaal on the second day of the protest. Protesters who attempted to block roads with their cars clashed with police. The police made more arrests on Thursday, according to reports the people were arrested after a police vehicle was partly set alight.   A group of ANC, EFF and members of the Congress of South African Students (Cosas) continued to picket outside the school. Some protesters attempted to set up barricades outside the Afrikaans-medium school which has been hit by accusations of racism after it refused to admit 55 English-speaking pupils. The police separated the parents and the protesters for fear of violent clashes as experienced on the first day of the protest. One of the protesters said that they were not at the school to tamper with the education of the kids. Meanwhile, Cosas has vowed to shut down the school if it does not admit the leaners. Provincial Chairperson Wandile Mofokeng said: “We want those 55 learners being placed in this school regardless of their language. We are going to shut down this school, there is no one who going to enter now, there is no one who is going to come out. “We want to shut down this school until the MEC of education disbands this SGB and appoints an interim administration that will be in charge of the school that is not racist.” Over 10 people arrested yet again after a police car was set on fire @ANN7tv #Hoërskoolovervaal pic.twitter.com/L14DPbTXfl — sindisiwe twala (@TwalaSindisiwe) January 18, 2018
