IN A CAREER spanning more than five decades Hugh Masekela released more than 50 albums and records and won two Grammy awards. He scooped his first Grammy in 1968 in the category of best contemporary pop performance instrumental for the Grazin’ In The Grass album. There were seven other Grammy nods with his last nomination coming as recently as 2013 for his 2010 album, Jabulani in the best world music category. After going on an extensive homecoming tour in the 1990s and revitalising the local music scene with his professionalism, President Jacob Zuma honoured him with the South African National Order of Ikhamanga in Gold at a National Orders Ceremony on April 27, 2010. His musical contributions were also not ignored by institutions of higher learning, both locally and internationally. In 2014 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in music by the University of York with Rhodes University following with a doctor of music (honoris causa) in the following year. In 2017 Wits University conferred an honorary doctor of music degree on Bra Hugh in the Great Hall where he had performed as a 19-year-old member of the orchestra in the opening concert of Todd Matshikiza’s jazz opera, King Kong.
