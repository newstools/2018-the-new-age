THE police have launched a manhunt for suspects who torched 27 goats inside a kraal at a house in GaMashishi village near Burgersfort in the early hours of Monday morning. “Family members were awoken by a frantic and agonising noise made by the animals and upon investigation they found the entire kraal engulfed in huge flames. The firealso damaged the power lines and all 27 goats were badly burnt. The motive behind this incident is not known at this stage,” provincial police spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo said. “We are cautioning all people here not to resort to acts of vigilantism and vengeance but to give police the necessary assistance to investigate this matter without disturbance. Nobody has been arrested yet in connection with the incident.” The owner of the goats could not be reached for comment yesterday. A resident in the village, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “There is all sorts of enmity among various residents here, be it over personal wealth, children of so and so progressing well in education or even rivalry over gains from illegal chrome mining, but setting someone’s goats alight is mysterious. This has never happened before.” In another development a Toyota Quantum minibus taxi and two Toyota Conquest sedans were set alight at Eensaam village in Vleischboom outside Groblersdal in the ongoing feud among taxi operators on Monday morning about 10am. “Preliminary investigations revealed that two organisations, Nebo Taxi Association and Maxi Taxi Association are fighting over routes between Vleischboom and Eensaam. Four people were severely assaulted in the violence and were taken to hospital,” the police said. Provincial police commissioner LtGen Nneke Ledwaba has condemned the acts of vigilantism mushrooming among some communities. montshom@thenewage.co.za
