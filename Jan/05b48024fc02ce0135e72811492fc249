Arrested Crime Intelligence officer will appear at the Pretoria Magistrate’s court on Thursday for a formal bail application. The officer who is a captain at the crime intelligence unit was arrested by Independent Investigative Directorate (Ipid) officers on Tuesday while meeting his parole officer. He was released on parole in 2015 after serving a 10-year sentence for an armed robbery which was committed in Mamelodi in 1994. The suspect is accused of stealing thousands of rands from the SAPS secret fund meant for operational purposes. It is alleged that he submitted fraudulent invoices to crime intelligence. Independent Police Investigative Directorate(IPID) says they are still busy verifying his address and whether he has a criminal record before he applies for bail. -TNA Reporter
