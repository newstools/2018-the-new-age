As South Africa mourns the passing of the music legend Hugh Masekela, former soccer player Mark Fish has lightened Tweeps mood with his tribute to the wrong person. The soccer legend joined South Africans who paid their respect to the global icon on Twitter, however, he used a wrong picture of music legend Sipho ‘Hotstix’ Mabuse instead of Masekela. #MarkFish I am very much alive – oops ask my family or manager @MartinMyers or @BillyMonama – I am alive and well pic.twitter.com/5MWU2Hyhup — Hotstix (@siphohotstix) January 23, 2018 On the tweet, Fish extended his love and gratitude to Masekela. The tweet went viral and of course, gave birth to the #MarkfishChallenge. Mabuse took to Twitter to confirm that he is very much alive and well. Fish deleted the picture and apologised for the error but Tweeps wouldn’t let it go.
