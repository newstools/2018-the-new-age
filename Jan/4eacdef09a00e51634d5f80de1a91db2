Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng has called on Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi to engage with independent schools in order to place the more than 33 000 learners who have still not been placed by the department for the 2018 academic year. This was in response to Lesufi’s announcement yesterday that the department had placed only 2565 of the 31 000 learners who applied for admission in the province. The DA says it finds it regrettable that many learners are denied access to basic education due to the provincial government’s poor planning DA’s Shadow MEC of Education Khume Ramulifho says Lesufi must approach Finance MEC Barbara Creecy in order to access the R12 billion provincial reserve funds to ensure that educational needs are funded. “There should be no child of school going age sitting at home because the department has failed its obligation to provide basic education,” Ramulifho said. He said the DA will continue to visit schools to ensure that they have the necessary resources to ensure learning and teaching. -TNA Reporter
