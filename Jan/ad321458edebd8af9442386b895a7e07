Increasing the threshold to qualify for financial assistance to students from households with a combined annual income of up to R350000 reaffirms the government’s commitment to opening access to education for poor and working class students. This was the reaction from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) to President Jacob Zuma’s pronouncement on free higher education and training for deserving students. “NSFAS has been providing elements of free education through the provision of bursaries to TVET college students over the years, as well as some university students whose final year loans were converted to bursaries, based on their academic performances,” chief executive Steven Zwane said. “NSFAS is of the view that the president’s pronouncement, which involves doing away with the loan portion of the funding, will expand the reach and impact of free education that the government has been providing through NSFAS over the years. “We are proud to have provided financial assistance to more than three million beneficiaries since our establishment in 1991 and we are pleased to continue to build on this legacy.” The previous household income threshold for students to qualify for funding was R122000. Zwane said they had received 300000 applications for funding for this year, 80% of which have already been processed. Outcomes will be communicated to all students from today based on confirmation of institutional admission offers. “We define new ways to ensure an integrated approach to managing financial aid to students. We thank the government for the opportunity to continue transforming the lives of young people.” lillians@thenewage.co.za
