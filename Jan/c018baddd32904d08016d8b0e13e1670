The registration process at the Capricorn Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) College in Limpopo was suspended earlier today after prospective students were injured during a stampede while registering for the 2018 academic year. It is not clear why the stampede took place but it’s understood students had been gathered outside the institution’s gate this morning to register, with some having been in queues since Wednesday night. Limpopo police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said six prospective students were hospitalised with one in a critical condition. Mojapelo said security marshals have been deployed to the college to monitor the situation.   -TNA Reporter
