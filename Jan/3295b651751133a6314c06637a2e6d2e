IT IS almost impossible to grasp that Mamelodi Sundowns will soon take to the field with virtually a complete new team as their stars keep leaving. While they have not talked about it that much, Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has been silently rebuilding his squad with a second African Champions League trophy in mind. In the last two seasons Sundowns have lost Bongani Zungu, Surprise Moriri, Mzikayise Mashaba, Keagan Dolly, Leonardo Castro, Wayne Sandilands, Teko Modise, Rodney Ramagalela, Ramahlwe Mphahlele, Lebohang Mokoena and Katlego Mashego. The Brazilians are also likely to lose Khama Billiat, Siyanda Zwane, Asavela Mbekile and Mogakolodi Ngele – either quite soon or at the end of the season. In between winning the Champions League, the Nedbank Cup and the CAF Super Cup, Sundowns’ rebuilding process included the arrivals of Sibusiso Vilakazi, Yannick Zakri, Fares Hachi, Lucky Mohomi, Oupa Manyisa, Thokozani Sekotlong, George Lebese, Thapelo Morena and Anele Ngcongca. Former Cape Town City winger Aubrey Ngoma is the latest to join the Brazilians, with SuperSport United striker Jeremy Brockie expected to be the next top performer to join. All this, according to Mosimane, is in preparation for the Champions League that the Brazilians successfully won in 2016, but failed to defend in 2017, where they were knocked out in the quarterfinals. “One of the main reasons Ngoma is here is the Champions League. It is important that we do well. We have to wait for him to recover from injury, like other players such as Vila. But I don’t want to talk about injuries right now,” Mosimane said. Having failed to win a trophy last year, the Brazilians are eager to bag some silverware, with the league title a big possibility as they find themselves at the top of the log. They next have a big encounter in the PSL against Orlando Pirates set for Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Saturday. -MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE
