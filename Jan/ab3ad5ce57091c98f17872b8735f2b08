EFF members are protesting outside the H&M clothing store in Gateway Mall, Umhlanga. Security and police have been deployed to prevent protesters from attacking the store. Earlier this week, the protesters attempted to attack the retailer but were escorted out of the mall. The incident comes after an ‘offensive’ advert that featured a black child modeling in a “coolest monkey in the jungle” green hoodie emerged on social media. EFF members trashed several stores around the country in an attempt to meet with the H&M management. EFF leader Julius Malema had warned South Africans to stay away from H&M stores after the recent ‘racist’ advert saga. “We should stay away from H&M and if I were H&M I would not even open the stores because the unannounced actions of the EFF may continue if there is no positive response from H&M,” he said. -TNA Reporter
