Democratic Alliance (DA) Shadow Minister of Basic Education Nomsa Marchesi MP visited Fisantekraal Secondary School, which was ranked among the most improved schools in the Western Cape. Marchesi said last year Fisantekraal achieved a pass rate increase of 14.7%, though faced with a number of challenges. “The principal and teachers have put in great effort into ensuring that their matriculants are successful in their exams.” She added that every child has the right to quality basic education and without adequate institutional support, children will be deprived of bright futures and will struggle to be absorbed into the labour force. “It is precisely for this reason that the DA will ensure that there is a sustained improvement of pass rates in our schools.” Marchesi further said the school is looking forward to this year, and they will be focusing on Mathematics and Sciences. -TNA Reporter
