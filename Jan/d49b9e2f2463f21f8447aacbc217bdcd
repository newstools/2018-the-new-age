Embattled city of Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille says she is now waiting for the outcome after making submissions to the DA’s federal executive on Sunday. “I just made my oral submissions, so I will wait for the outcome now,” de Lille said.  The mayor appeared before the DA’s highest decision making body on Sunday, which is expected to make a decision on allegations of corruption and maladministration against her.  De Lille has previously said she is innocent and called on those tying her to claims of corruption to produce evidence. “Well, I just really repeated to say, please give me a fair opportunity for all these allegations to be tested and expressed my concern about the narrative that I am corrupt and trying to cover up for corruption. I will leave it to the federal executive now to decide.” De Lille said she hoped the federal executive handled the matter fairly.  “I hope that they will consider fairly all my submissions.”  After making her submissions the mayor visited the World Harvest Christian Ministry in Langa, where she received prayers.   “Thank you, World Harvest Christian Ministry in Langa for inviting me for prayer and encouragement. I remain as committed as ever to serving the people of Cape Town. My heartfelt thanks also goes to the many people across Cape Town and South Africa for their messages of support,” she wrote on Twitter. -TNA Reporter
