The city council in the City of Cape Town has decided not to go ahead with a controversial proposalÂ to introduce a drought levy. The council is now in discussions to introduce punitive water tariffs, to discourage reckless water usage. City of Cape Town Executive Mayor Patricia De Lille, in a special meeting with council members today, said Day Zero was now imminent and those who did not heed the call to save water would be dealt with. -TNA Reporter
