AS THE second week of 2018 starts, Bernard Molekwa will find himself on a high that many can only dream of. And with good reason as there is no faulting the Polokwane City coach after he orchestrated another tactical masterclass against Mamelodi Sundowns in the PSL to win 3-2. This is the second time this season that City have beaten Sundowns and just as was the case late last year, it was Rise and Shine striker Rodney Ramagalela who settled the thrilling encounter with a stunning strike. Molekwa, who is fast carving his own history at City and moving out from former coach Luc Eymael’s shadow said while he is happy with the big win against Sundowns, which was actually their first at home this season, he is worried that his team only bring their best football against big teams. Even though Kaizer Chiefs are coming up on Saturday, Molekwa wants his team to show the same determination and character when they face Steve Komphela’s side. “This is a nice feeling for us. It is our first win at home this season and we have managed to complete a double against Sundowns and take six points from them. The boys fought hard. “This win should not go to this players’ heads because we have four games in January that are tough. We need to be level headed. “A win against Sundowns always puts your next opponent on high alert and Kaizer Chiefs will work hard at stopping us,” Molekwa said. “We will have to redouble our efforts to win that one. But I am happy that we came back from behind against Sundowns. This is the kind of character that will help us reach our targets this season. I just don’t want this kind of performance to be there only when we meet Sundowns and Chiefs. I want to see it all the time,” the City coach said. City’s win over Sundowns lifted them to 11th on the log with 18 points from 15 games, while Sundowns remain top with 28 points from 15. -MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
