THE notorious criminals of KwaMashu have struck again and are this time targeting Uber, Taxify and metered taxi drivers servicing the township. As a result of the surging robberies of the drivers, police have warned them to be on high alert when requested to transport passengers to the notorious township, which once recorded the highest number of deaths and robberies in the country. Police spokesperson Col Thembeka Mbhele said the criminals’ modus operandi is to pretend to be clients who want to be fetched from restaurants, nightclubs or other places to their requested destinations around KwaMashu. The suspects then stop the drivers at gunpoint and rob them of their belongings and take their vehicles. Mbhele outlined two recently reported incidents which made them issue the warning to the drivers. “On December 31 at 10 pm, a 41-year-old driver was dropping off a passenger on Ndlondo Road in G section, who had paid a short fare and told the driver to wait for someone who would pay the full amount. All of a sudden the complainant was held up at gunpoint,” Mbhele said. The robbers took cash and his two cellphones and fled the scene.” In another incident, which Mbhele said happened on Monday at 11 pm, a 24-year-old driver was contacted to pick up a passenger, who later turned out to be a criminal from Phoenix who was traveling to the J section of Kwa-Mashu. “Upon arrival at the destination, the suspect ordered that he be dropped off, pulled out a firearm and threatened the driver. “A second suspect approached them and they demanded his cellphone and took cash. The driver was forced to get into the boot of the car,” she said. Mbhele said charges of robbery were being investigated at KwaMashu SAPS in order to apprehend the criminals. “We are appealing to drivers to be vigilant and take extra precautions when asked to pick up clients,” she said. sihlem@thenewage.co.za
