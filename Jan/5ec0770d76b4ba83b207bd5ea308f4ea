Fifty nine protesters are expected to appear in the Krugersdorp Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday on charges of public violence. The suspects were arrested in Mogale City, Krugersdorp on Monday, following a protest action. The protest got out of hand as residents took to the street to express their anger against drug dealers and child traffickers in the area. Violence broke out as protesters started throwing stones at a police vehicle and burning tyres. -TNA Reporter
