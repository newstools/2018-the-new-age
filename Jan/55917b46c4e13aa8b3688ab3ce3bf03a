Communications Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane has started the new year with a slight tiff with former tourism minister Derek Hanekom over social media use, she believes is inappropriate. Taking to Twitter, Kubayi-Ngubane called out Hanekom for “…continued use of social media to the detriment of ANC…” I’m shocked by ure continued use of social media to the detriment of ANC Cde Derek. https://t.co/0iUPxw2K8y — RSA Minister: Comms (@mmKubayiNgubane) January 1, 2018 This comes after Hanekom responded to another tweet which could be interpreted as a showing of support for an early recall of former ANC president Jacob Zuma from the Union Buildings. “Perhaps I am naive, but I am hoping that some sanity will prevail, and the sensible and honorouble thing will be done before the 10th,” Hanekom tweeted. A tug-of-war has slowly been brewing since Cyril Ramaphosa ascended to replace Zuma as party president last month during the ANC 54th national elective conference. The ANC’s new national executive committee (NEC) is scheduled to sit for its first meeting of the year next week and it is expected that the calls for Zuma to be removed will feature on the meeting’s agenda. Meanwhile, adding to the growing chorus for Zuma’s removal, the ANC stalwarts and veterans have called on Zuma to “voluntarily step down in the interests of the country and the African National Congress.” The stalwarts, who have been consistent critics of Zuma, have called on him to pass the reigns of leadership to Ramaphosa. Civil society groups had also stepped up pressure on Ramaphosa to produce an exit plan for Zuma in return for their endorsement of his bid for the ANC presidency. -TNA Reporter
