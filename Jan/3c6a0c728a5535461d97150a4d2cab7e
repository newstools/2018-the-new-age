Unisa Management has announced that they remain open for salary negotiations with their staff members. This follows a protest by National Education Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) members demanding 12% salary increment. The members threatened to go on an unending strike if their demands are not met by the university’s management. The university had announced that it can only afford a 6.5% increase. However, Unisa’s spokesperson Martin Ramotshela said the university is willing to negotiate a salary increment. -TNA Reporter
