US President Donald Trump on Friday asked the African Union chairman to pass on his “warmest regards” to other AU leaders at a summit this weekend, after sparking outrage this month with a reported slur against Africans. Meeting Rwandan President Paul Kagame on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, Trump said: “I want to congratulate you, Mr President, on being the new head of the African Union, that’s a great honour… I know you’re going to your first meeting shortly. Please give my warmest regards.” AFP
