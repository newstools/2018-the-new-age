Limpopo police are investigating a case of culpable homicide following the death of two people in Lephalale on Monday morning. According to police, the two taxis, a Toyota Quantum and a VW Crafter were travelling in opposite directions on Markenon Road outside Lephalale. Spokesperson Maphure Manamela said the Crafter was travelling from Polokwane to Lephalale town with the driver and one passenger, while the quantum was going in the opposite direction with only the driver. “Both vehicles caught fire on impact and the two drivers were burned beyond recognition. The 29-year-old female passenger was transported to a hospital with severe burn wounds.” Manamela said at this stage, they cannot release the identities of the deceased as their next of kin are yet to be informed. -TNA Reporter
