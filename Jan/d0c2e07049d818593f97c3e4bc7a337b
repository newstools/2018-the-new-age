Former Gauteng health MEC Qedani Mahlangu has said she had no reason to doubt any information given to her by former Gauteng health head of department Barney Selebano and former Gauteng director of mental health Makgabo Manamela because they were qualified doctors and had worked for the department for many years. Mahlangu was testifying for a second day at the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings in Parktown, Johannesburg. She said Selebano executed the termination of the Life Esidimeni contracts after a collective decision was made. Justice Dikgang Moseneke told the former MEC the decision taken by “her collective” had claimed the lives of 143 mentally ill patients. Mahlangu said that when the decision to terminate the contracts was made, the department had a plan to place the patients in government hospitals and NGOs. “The initial plan was to take the mental care users to government hospitals and a lesser number of patients to the NGOs.” She said her officials provided her with a file that explained the processes that would be used to place patients at the NGOs and she did not have a reason to doubt the information in the files. -TNA Reporter
