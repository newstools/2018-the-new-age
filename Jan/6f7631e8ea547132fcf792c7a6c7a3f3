The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Arts and Culture Xoliswa Tom has joined celebrities and high profile people in paying tribute to the legendary musician Hugh Masekela. Masekela died on Tuesday at the age of 78 after a decade-long battle with prostate cancer. Tom said the committee is saddened by his passing despite knowing the medical challenges he was experiencing. “Although the Committee knew of the medical challenges he was experiencing, we remained hopeful through prayer that he will overcome this adversity as he had overcome many in his lifetime. We are thus saddened that he has lost his battle with cancer.” Tom added that Masekela’s contribution in the fight against apartheid was seen in his music. “His role in the fight against the brutal apartheid regime was immense and songs like ‘Bring Him Back Home’ which advocated for the release of Nelson Mandela signify his love for his country and his role in the anti-apartheid movement. “Although he spent many years in exile as a result of the apartheid regime, through his music he remained grounded in Africa and ensuring the development and advancement of the continent. This was emphasized by songs such as ‘Stimela’ which amplified the harshness of the migrant labour system on the family unit in the continents.”
