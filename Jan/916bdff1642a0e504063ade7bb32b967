The South African Police Service (Saps) as called on members of the public to help find a missing couple who were on holiday in the Eastern Cape. Guy Mclaughlin, 40 and Lindsay Lamb, 33 were reported missing after their family members failed to get hold of them. Warrant Officer Andrew Bovey said the couple were going to travel up to Hogsback and then proceed up the Wild Coast before travelling back to Gauteng. “Information from relatives initially suggested that they left Grahamstown for Hogsback on Friday, 5 January 2018. A vehicle matching the description was seen on the N2 on Friday travelling towards Butterworth by traffic officers conducting speed traps.
