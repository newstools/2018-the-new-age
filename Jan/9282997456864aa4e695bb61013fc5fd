Tensions seemed to have decreased outside Hoërskool Overvaal on Friday as only a few protesters were seen outside the school. A number of protesters went to the Vereeniging Magistrate’s Court to support the 27 people arrested outside the school on Thursday. South African Police Service spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said the protesters arrested were charged with public violence. Meanwhile, the parents of some Hoërskool Overvaal pupils and community members also gathered outside the school on Friday morning to show support for the institution and its language policy. This followed a WhatsApp voice note that was reportedly sent out to the community to gather in solidarity with the school. The parents said they could not comment on the protests, adding that their only concern was for the pupils’ safety. -TNA Reporter
