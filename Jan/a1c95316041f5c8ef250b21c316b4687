The day of reckoning is fast approaching for Andre Slade, the infamous owner of the now-closed Sodwana Bay guest house who was dragged to court in November for his refusal to accept black guests, saying they were not human beings. The court date is expected early next month. The Isimangaliso Wetland Park and the Department of Tourism made their arguments before Ubombo magistrate Tamo Moodley, demanding that Slade be fined for his behaviour. Moodley withheld judgment and is expected to issue it before the end of February. The two applicants argued that Slade’s behaviour was “toxic for the tourism industry” which seeks to cater for all human races on an equal basis. As a result, they want him to be fined R50000 and that it should be paid to any nonprofit organisation in the Mhlathuze (Richards Bay) area. Despite facing mounting legal troubles, Slade remained defiant in his responding court papers, telling the court while under oath that black people falsely believe they “are equal
human beings to whites when they are not”. He argued that he based his defence according to “God’s laws that there should segregation of blacks and white”. The New Age is in possession of his court papers and those of the applicants who filed for crimen injuria charges. The uproar and subsequent legal backlash began in June 2016 when email communication between Slade and a potential black customer, who happened to be a South African civil
servant, was leaked online. sihlem@thenewage.co.za
