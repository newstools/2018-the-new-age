ANC and South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) members have joined protests outside Hoërskool Overvaal under heavy police guard and private security watch. The protests started last week after the North Gauteng High Court dismissed a decision by the Gauteng education department to enroll 55 more students at the school for the 2018 academic year. Ten protesters were arrested and a police car petrol bombed last week. Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi announced that the department would be appealing the North Gauteng High Court’s decision. The South African Council of Churches (Sacc), led by Bishop Reverent Gift Moerane, earlier on Monday held a meeting with the school governing body, its principal and the parents to try to defuse tensions. -TNA Reporter
