Late President Nelson Mandela’s former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela has been discharged from Milpark hospital. The struggle stalwart spent 10 days in hospital after she was admitted to hospital for complaining about leg pain and loss of appetite. “I’m pleased to be going back home where I’ll be able to rest and fully recuperate from the short illness,” said Madikizela-Mandela.

Upon admission, it was discovered that she had an infection that had affected her kidneys,” said the family -TNA Reporter
