National Education Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) members at Unisa have threatened to go on an indefinite strike if their demands for a 12% salary increase is not met by the university’s management. The union handed in a memorandum to the university management yesterday announcing that it would be embarking on a strike and detailing several demands to management. The strike is expected to hugely disrupt the registration process for new students as some were turned back this morning. The university announced that it can only afford a 6.5% increase. Among the demands, Nehawu said they demand that all council members stop doing business with the university with immediate effect as this shows how little they care about workers, but how to corruptly continue to milk the university. They also demands that all council members implicated in the Public Protector’s State of Capture Report resign from the council with immediate effect and that the university absorbs all contract workers. Spokesperson Khaya Xaba says they believe the university can afford the 12% increase that the workers are demanding. “The university attracts and register over 400 000 students annually and
preserving more than R400 billion in reserves. Our view is that they are being
disingenuous when they plead poverty.” He says they are prepared to go on a full strike at all Unisa campuses until their demands are met. Attempts to reach Unisa spokesperson Martin Ramotshela were unsuccessful. –TNA Reporter
