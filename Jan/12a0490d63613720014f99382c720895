The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) has condemned the attacks that took place at the Hoerskool Overvaal in Vereeniging. The union said the attacks justified the demonstration of the disappointing court judgment on Gauteng Department of Education’s placement of 55 grade 8 learners. Sadtu Provincial Secretary Tseliso Ledimo said Hoerskool is a public school which must serve the needs of the immediate community which is largely a black community. “Community members around Overvaal Hoerskool are forced to transport their children far from their area of residence because the management wants to keep the school as an Afrikaans medium school.” Ledimo has also expressed his disappointment over the fact that the school has about 22 educators who are all white, both state and SGB employed. “We condemn racism and we shall mount a campaign to transform the school together with progressive structures and we support the GDE’s resolve to appeal this anti transformation court judgment.” -TNA Reporter
