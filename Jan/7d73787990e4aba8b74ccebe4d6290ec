Also seems like young woman who go missing in Kagiso and other neighbouring places end up at those drug houses.#kagisoIsBurning pic.twitter.com/oQvnwGans1 — Tumelo (@The_ElementalDJ) January 22, 2018 Let us pray that the march against drugs in #Kagiso today will be peaceful, this is just an example of what damage corruption can cause, Police know the drug lords and their dealers but instead of arresting them they chose 2 take money. — Rolisizwe Lunika (@Rolisizwe) January 22, 2018 Nigerians trigger xenophobia and play victims when it happens.
A girl from Kagiso (west Rand) was abducted and Found at a “drug club” owned by negerians in Krugersdop. What must we do as SAns?? Sit back and watch? Wait for unresponsive policemen? Enough is enough #CleanUp — Aphindile Madoda (@JournoNod) January 22, 2018 It’s intense. Large groups of people coming down on Kagiso Drive. pic.twitter.com/P6Jds4xEbk — William George (@JusCallMeWill) January 22, 2018 The protest, which has been joined by taxi drivers, comes after a 17-year-old girl was rescued after being kidnapped by a foreign national. Community members have since accused police of not doing much to eradicate drugs in their community, claiming that the police get money from drug dealers. Messages circulated at the weekend urged residents to stay away from school and work on Monday.
