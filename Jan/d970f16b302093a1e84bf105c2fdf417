SHEMBE’S Ebuhleni section holy pilgrimage to the church’s holy mountain of Khenana in Bhamshela is expected to come to an end today. The journey officially began with about 500 000 members taking part earlier this week. This is a big increase compared to last year’s 350000 members participation. Thokozani Mncwabe, the spokesperson of the church, said the journey would last for three days, thereafter members would go back to Ebuhleni headquarters in Inanda to conclude it. He said the journey commenced shortly after midnight on Tuesday and has seen members going to the mountain to pray and have the sick healed. Along the way, members will have breaks to rest as directed by their prophet until they reach the mountain. It is on the mountain where after the top leadership of the church perform religious ceremonies, massive praying and healing will start for the sick. “Depending on how fast we move, the journey will not take more three days and thereafter members will go back to Ebuhleni,” Mncwabe said. Mncwabe said as usual, their annual pilgrimage to the holy mountain had attracted people from all walks of life and all corners of southern Africa where it has got its presence. He said leading the walk to the mountain will be their prophet, inkosi Mduduzi Nyazilwezulu Shembe. “The number of the members to take part may increase as some people will join us along the way to be part of this sacred pilgrimage,” Mncwabe said. Most members of the church started to trickle into the headquarters as early as Sunday when the year was about to end to get good spots to pitch their tents before starting the journey.  -SIHLE MAVUSO|sihlem@thenewage.co.za
