Cosatu provincial spokesperson Lumka Tamboer says the DA and the City of Cape Town should take responsibility for the water crisis because they failed to implement short-term mitigation strategies when the crisis was confirmed. “The city and provincial government did not take the water issues seriously when Cosatu first brought it to their attention. “The city could have saved us millions of litres of water if they had responded to the discussions with urgency.” Cosatu is of the view that the DA is not fit to resolve the water crisis in Cape Town. Tamnoer added that the announcement to continue water supply to the city centre at the expense of township people is discriminatory and will start conflict in the community. “We need credible leaders to take urgent actions to save the city.” -TNA Reporter
