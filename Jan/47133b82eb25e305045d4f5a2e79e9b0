The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) has called for a motion of no confidence against city of Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba for failing to take responsibility for corruption that occurred under his watch. Sanco’s call follows a decision by Mashaba to remove Rabelani Dagada as a member of the mayoral committee for finance after a forensic investigation found him in breach of the city’s code of conduct. Spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu said Mashaba’s refusal to take responsibility confirmed the organisation’s suspicion that the DA was a party in crisis. “The developments in the city of Cape Town and Johannesburg not only confirm that the DA is an organisation in deep crisis but have exposed its double standards and blatant refusal to take responsibility for governance failures,” Mahlangu said. Mahlangu said, if the DA was serious about fighting corruption, it would be laying criminal charges against Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lillie and Dagada and summarily dismiss both of them. Dagada was dismissed after the forensic investigation found him in breach of the city’s code of conduct and conflict of interest. In October, Dagada was implicated in a scandal where it was alleged that he enriched his friend by facilitating access to lucrative tenders. Mahlangu said the DA should go to the nearest police station to lay corruption charges against de Lille and Dagada as the party had done against other leaders. “The DA has made the South African Police Service charge office its playground whenever untested allegations are raised against ANC members. It is visibly dragging its feet when it has to take responsibility for its failed cadre deployment and maladministration.” He said the Public Protector must review the two cases objectively and then recommend appropriate action to avoid cover-ups that have been seen on all issues before the DA’s Federal Legal Commission. -TNA Reporter
