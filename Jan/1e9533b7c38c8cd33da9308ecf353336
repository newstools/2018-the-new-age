Democratic Alliance (DA) in Free State has called on Premier Ace Magashule to immediately tender his resignation following his election as ANC’s Secretary General. The DA says Magashule has governed the Free State like a mouse in charge of the cheese, and his election as ANC Secretary-General came as a relief to many people in the province. The party said it is worried that nothing has been done or said about Magashule’s position as the Premier of Free State which is illegal given his position in the ANC. DA’s Leader in Free State Dr Roy Jankielsohn said it is obvious that Magashule is delaying his resignation as premier in order to tie up loose ends and secure the continuation of his extensive factional network of patronage that has been built at the expense of the people of the Free State. “The silence regarding the issue of Ace Magashule serving as SG of the ANC and as Premier of the Free State simultaneously needs to be broken. The people of the Free State require clarity around this issue since it is common knowledge that the position of SG is a full-time paid position.” Jankielsohn said it is clear that a full-time position at Luthuli House is not compatible with an important position like a premier. “Magashule is already failing to attend crucial sessions of the Legislature regularly as required from a Premier.” Jankielsohn also criticised operation Hlasela, an initiative established by Magashule to speed up service delivery in the province. “At a provincial government level, Premier Magashule abused Operation Hlasela to expand his patronage network. The Public Protector also indicated that Operation Hlasela conflated the boundaries between a political party, the ANC, and the state,” he said. -TNA Reporter
