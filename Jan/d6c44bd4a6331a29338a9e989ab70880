Eden Hazard scored his 100th career league goal when he struck in the third minute for Chelsea in their Premier League clash with Brighton on Saturday. The 27-year-old Belgian star — who had lost his goal touch of late after a blistering start to the season — scored after Brighton’s Dale Stephens failed to properly clear Victor Moses’s cross. The goal was Hazard’s 64th for Chelsea since he joined them in 2012 having found the net 36 times for French Ligue 1 outfit Lille. For good measure he added a second in the second-half — his eighth league goal this term — as Chelsea eased to a 4-0 win over the struggling Seagulls. “It’s my job (scoring goals), that’s why I like to play football,” said Hazard. A young fan, who was holding a piece of paper with “Hazard 10 can I have your shirt”, had his wish come true as the Belgian went over after the final whistle and handed it to him. -AFP
