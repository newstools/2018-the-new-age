AS REPORTS emerged that the DA’s Cape metro executive wanted to ditch Patricia de Lille as Cape Town mayor, one of her supporters and allies has called for the re-establishment of her former political party, the Independent Democrats, if she is axed. Battling for her political life, De Lille said in a statement yesterday that the party wanted to replace her with Western Cape housing MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela. “It illustrates my previous position that these attacks on me have been about power and positions all along,” De Lille said. She rejected allegations of corruption against her and promised to challenge any move by the DA to dismiss her. The threat to relaunch the party – which had a strong following among the coloured community and which De Lille had brought into a political marriage with the DA in 2010 – as an alternative to the DA came from Rodney Lennit. He is one of those who moved to the DA with her. He resigned as a member of the Western Cape legislature a year ago shortly after De Lille quit as Western Cape leader of the party. Lenntit made his threat in an online petition calling on DA leader Mmusi Maimane “to stop the DA from ousting Patricia de Lille”. He plans to hand over his petition to Maimane, DA federal council chairperson James Selfe and De Lille. He posted on Facebook that the DA was planning to oust De Lille as mayor of Cape Town without following the due process. “Why has there been no disciplinary hearing by the DA for Patricia de Lille on the alleged allegations? As voters, we want to hear Patricia de Lille’s response to the alleged allegations of mismanagement,” he said in his post. -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
