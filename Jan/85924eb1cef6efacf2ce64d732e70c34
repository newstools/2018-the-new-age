ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule yesterday brushed aside questions about whether or not President Jacob Zuma would clarify and release the terms of reference of the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture amid escalating confusion. Briefing journalists at the ANC’s national executive committee (NEC) meeting in Irene outside Pretoria ahead of its lekgotla at the weekend, Magashule said the discussion would be better left to Zuma and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa. “We can’t get into that because this is the ANC party (meeting). We can’t decide on the terms of reference, we are not the government. We’ll just say speed up the establishment of the commission,” Magashule said. As speculation mounted that the ANC would be discussing Zuma’s political future this week, Magashule scotched rumours of Zuma’s recall as head of state, saying the matter was not an agenda item up for discussion.
