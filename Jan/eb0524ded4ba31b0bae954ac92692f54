An ANC councilor was stabbed to death on Monday at a Richards Bay beach in KwaZulu-Natal. Ward 2 councilor Njabulo “Jija” Dlamini was with his family, celebrating the first day of the New Year, when an unknown attacker allegedly approached him and asked him to step aside, and an argument broke out. “Details regarding Cde Dlamini’s murder remain sketchy but it appears that his attacker withdrew a knife and stabbed him before disappearing into the multitude of beach goers,” ANC far North Regional Secretary Nkosingiphile Mlambo said. Mlambo said the ANC was horrified at losing such a young activist who was loved by the community he served. Dlamini’s untimely passing will leave a void in the ranks of the ANC, the alliance and the mass democratic movement in general, that will not be easy to fill. -TNA Reporter
