EFF members have reportedly attacked the H&M clothing store in Mall of Africa. The members are said to be protesting outside the store. Police and security are currently on the scene. The incident comes two days after the EFF stormed several H&M clothing stores in Gauteng. Last week, the store issued an apology over its criticised advert, which featured a black child modeling with the slogan “coolest monkey in the jungle” written across his chest.

Gauteng Chairperson Mandisa Sibongile Mashego said this is a continuing protest as the EFF had started. “We simply wanted to drive the message home that the protest was not just a weekend special. “This is not just a passing trend, we are deeply humiliated as black South Africans to be called by monkeys by H&M. “We are extremely sensitive post the apartheid effects of slavery and abuse of workers rights, poverty, and ignorance,” she said. -TNA Reporter
