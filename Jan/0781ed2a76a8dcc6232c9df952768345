Cosatu in the Western Cape has criticised former provincial premier Tony Leon for receiving money for only telling Cape Town residents whether it had or had not rained. On Friday, the city of Cape Town’s media team announced that public relations (PR) firm Resolve Communication, owned by Leon and former DA communications director Nick Clelland, was hired by the city to provide strategic advice on how to improve its drought crisis communication. The company is being paid R165 500 a month. The contract comes to an end at the end of February. Cosatu Western Cape secretary Tony Ehrenreich said, even though it was not illegal for Leon to be getting such amounts of money, it was immoral for him to do so. Ehrenreich said the revelations were coming out following the resignation of former municipal manager Achmat Ebrahim. “This is another of the details of the new brand of corruption that is emerging after the stepping down of the city manager. ” Ehrenreich said. Ehrenreich said Leon is paid large amounts of money for doing nothing. “The only thing that Tony Leon does is to sit on his chair and at 10 am every morning, send out a press statement to say that it has not rained today and it is not wet and no more water went into the dams. For this, he gets nearly a million rand.” Ehrenreich also called for the investigation of the city of Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille’s sister Veronica Paulse after allegations of nepotism emerged against de Lille. -TNA Reporter
