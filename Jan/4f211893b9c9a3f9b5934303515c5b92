Gauteng Education Department MEC Panyaza Lesufi has warned parents who had threatened to disrupt schooling to remain calm following the ruling that went against the department. He said that the department would proceed to challenge the court ruling. The school has being accused of racism by some as it is believed that the exclusion of the of the 55 English-speaking pupils is due to the schools language preference the by the Afrikaans medium school. In an judgment this week the GDE lost its case to open the school to the pupils. It intends to appeal the judgment.
