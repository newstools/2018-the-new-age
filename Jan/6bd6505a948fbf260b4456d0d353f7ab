The DA has laid criminal charges against acting municipal manager of the Maluti-a-Phofung local municipality, Solomon Nyembe. The party has accused Nyembe of irregularly facilitating the loading of 558 individuals onto the municipal payroll system on 15 and 21 December 2017, who immediately received an immediate payment of approximately R7 000 each, despite not yet having reported for duty. DA MPL Leona Kleynhans said the party had been informed that some of the individuals paid are from the Eastern Cape. “The total monthly cost to the municipality is about R3.9 million and calculates to about R46.8 million per year,” Kleynhans said. She said, according to the DA’s sources, the individuals were loaded onto the payroll system using previous workers’ payroll numbers, which, if proven to be true, constitutes fraud. Kleynhans said, under the mayorship of Vusi Tshabalala, Maluti-a-Phofung had become a failed municipality. “The municipality owes Eskom almost R2 billion for bulk electricity supply and approximately R235 million to the water board for bulk water supply, while the delivery of basic services has become erratic at best and non-existent at worst.” She said the DA trusted that the South African Police Service would duly investigate the allegations with the urgency it deserved. -TNA Reporter
