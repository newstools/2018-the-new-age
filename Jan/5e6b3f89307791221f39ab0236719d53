Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says his department will not allow a situation where pupils are deprived their right to education due to a school’s language preference. “You cannot have a situation where parents apply to a school and you do not get accepted purely because you are speaking Zulu, or Sepedi,” Lesufi said. The MEC was speaking in the midst of a legal battle at the North Gauteng High Court earlier today between the department and Hoërskool Overvaal in Vereeniging. The school approached the court in an effort to overturn a decision by the department, forcing it to accept an additional 55 pupils for the 2018 academic year.  The school has claimed it does not have the capacity to accommodate more pupils but the department believes pupils were denied access based on the school’s language preference. The school’s Afrikaans-only language policy had previously been rejected by the department.  “We are of the view to introduce another language, preferably English and we will provide all the relevant support that is needed. We are of the view that the school has capacity of more than 800 pupils and the figure at our disposal is that the school currently has around 600.” Lesufi said his department would argue that the school had available space to take on more pupils.  “Where we stand, we believe all our schools belongs to all our children. There must be no one who believes that that they can determine the future of our children on the basis of language. If we tolerate that kind of behavior, we believe that we would have failed in our mandate to build a true non-racial country.”  -TNA Reporter
