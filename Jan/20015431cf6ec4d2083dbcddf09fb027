The government, led by the justice, crime prevention and security cluster, will launch Operation Fiela Two in Pretoria on Friday. A workshop is expected to outline the plans around the operation, which seeks to fight crime and corruption. GCIS spokesperson Takalani Mukwevho said, picking up from the first Operation Fiela’s successes, the National Joints Operational and Intelligence Structure would continue to implement a multi-disciplinary and integrated approach. “All law enforcement agencies and departments will come together in enforcing their respective legislative mandates,” Mukwevho said. Operation Fiela Two will focus on eradicating various types of crime and addressing safety concerns. “The operation will continue to implement the Integrated National Action Plan to re-asset the authority of the state to mitigate the increased levels of lawlessness, impunity, intolerance and disregard for the rule of law.” -TNA Reporter
