DA Deputy Shadow Minister of Basic Education Minister Nomsa Marchesi MP has congratulated the matric class of 2017 and wish ed them the best as they wait for their results which are expected to be announced by the Minister of Basic Education tomorrow. Marchesi also announced that she will also be attending the ceremony. Minister Angie Motshekga is expected to announce the results tomorrow. Marchesi says like everyone else, she was shocked by last year’s revelation that 78% of Grade 4 learners were illiterate. “The DA is committed to the provision of quality basic education and will continue the fight to ensure that all our children have access to it,” Marchesi said. She said it was imperative to know whether there has been any progress made in the performance of the schooling system at the senior level given that 41% of the learners who were doing Grade 10 in 2015 did not enrol for matric in 2017. -TNA Reporter
