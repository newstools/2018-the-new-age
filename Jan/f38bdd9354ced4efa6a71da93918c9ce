The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) says the Durban University of Technology (DUT) has hired private bodyguards for Vice Chancellor Thandwa Mthembu. Nehawu has been on strike at DUT for the past three weeks over a wage dispute and alleged financial mismanagement by the institution. The union is demanding a 10% wage increase across the board, a R9000 once off bonus and housing allowance. “We believe that our demands are reasonable and affordable considering that the university finances are healthy to an extent that the institution has hired private body guards for Vice Chancellor Mthembu,” Nehawu said in a statement. “Mthembu hired a university trailer in December last year which he never returned and claimed that it had been stolen and Nehawu cannot trust the VC with the resources of the university if he cannot look after a mere trailer.” “We must further record that Mthembu has now renegotiated his salary package and doubled his salary with the institution, making him the highest earning VC in the country.” Nehawu said Mthembu has turned DUT into a cash cow and if left attended, will surely finish what is left of the institution. The union has demanded strong leadership at DUT in order to end the current impasse between itself and university management. -TNA Reporter
