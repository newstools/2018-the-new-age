The National Student Financial Aid Scheme of South Africa (NSFAS) has on Thursday denied inaccurate information circulating on social media indicating that it had reopened its funding applications. “We have noted with concern incorrect information that NSFAS will open for funding applications effective from 3 January 2018. We would like to announce that this information did not come from NSFAS. Applications for 2018 funding opened on 1 Aug and closed on 30 Nov 2017,” said NSFAS in a statement. The message circulating does not come from the scheme, it said. NSFAS says it would cooperate with institutions of higher learning to assist students who have applied to the institutions and require funding even though they might not have applied for NSFAS funding. “NSFAS will not be reopening 2018 funding applications, but will work with institutions of higher learning to assist with funding decisions for students who have applied for academic spaces without having applied for NSFAS funding and others,” reads the statement. -TNA Reporter
