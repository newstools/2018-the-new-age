Cosatu in the Western Cape has threatened to disrupt the SUN Met horse racing event at Kenilworth next weekend. Cosatu’s wants former Steinhoff CEO Markus Jooste’s horses to be withdrawn from the race. Jooste resigned last year amid allegations of irregularities in its financial accounts that sparked investigations in South Africa and Germany. “The horse racing event to be held at Kenilworth will be protested by the workers if it includes horses of Markus Jooste. “Markus Jooste is nothing but a looter, who collapsed Steinhoff taking billions of rands from poor people’s pension funds. He did this while he and his girlfriend are riding around in luxury sedans,” said Cosatu in a statement. Cosatu said Jooste should be arrested and charged with corruption for the fraudulent financial activities he involved Steinhoff in. “We demand an undertaking be given by the organisers that no horses with links to Marcus Jooste will be allowed to participate in the race. Failing which, Cosatu will be protesting at the event for the return of the money, that Marcus Jooste looted from the company for his high life, which was paid for by workers’ retirement savings,” it said. -TNA Reporter
