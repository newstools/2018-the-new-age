The Commission for Gender Equality has lauded the arrest of nine suspects for the abduction and human trafficking of a 14-year-old girl in Idutywa in the Eastern Cape. The suspects appeared in the Idutywa Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. The commission has urged South Africans not to keep quiet about abduction and underage marriages in society. Chairperson Lulama Nare said the commission respected cultural freedom and choice but would not tolerate the abuse of cultural practices at the expense of women and young girls. “It is important for South Africans to note that no cultural or religious practices supersede the Constitution,” Nare said. The commission has also announced that it will be working closely with the South African Police Service and National Prosecuting Authority to tackle the issue of underage marriages. “Underage marriages are not only a women rights violation and harmful traditional practice but they rob young girls of education and dignity.” -TNA Reporter
