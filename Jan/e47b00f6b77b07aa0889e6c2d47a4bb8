Excitement has been mounting ahead of the ANC’s 106th birthday celebrations in East London tomorrow. This rally follows the party’s 54th national conference in December last year. The countdown to tomorrow’s celebration at the Absa Stadium kicked off on Tuesday when the party’s top six visited Nqadu village in Willowvale. Party leaders also visited kings around East London as part of the build-up. Supporters had the opportunity to take pictures with the newly elected ANC president, Cyril Ramaphosa, as he engaged with the public. “In celebrating the last 106 years of the ANC, we must never lose sight of the selfless sacrifices of thousands of people, many of whom remain nameless and faceless, who gave their lives for the freedoms we enjoy today. “The ANC is now, more than ever, united and determined to lead the struggle for a united, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous society,” the ANC said in a statement. “This will, however, only be achieved when we work together to address the persistent challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality. In this regard we have identified four key priorities, being to place the economy on a better trajectory, deepen transformation and consolidate the gains of democracy, relentlessly fight corruption in all its forms and build unity within the ANC and the country as a whole.” Yesterday, NEC members Nomvula Mokonyane, Lindiwe Sisulu and Tandi Mahambehlala handed over a house to a 92-year-old resident in Duncan village in East London, while Ramaphosa visited Qunu ahead of the festivities tomorrow. Secretary-general Ace Magashule met with the family of former ANC president AB Xuma. Ramaphosa will deliver the party’s annual January 8 speech tomorrow. news@thenewage.co.za
