Cosatu has welcomed President Jacob Zuma’s decision to appoint Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, as chosen by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, to head up a commission of inquiry into state capture. On Tuesday, Zuma announced that he was appointing Zondo to head up the commission, as per former public protector Thuli Madonsela’s instruction. Madonsela instructed Zuma to appoint a judge that would be handpicked by Mogoeng, to head up a commission that would investigate allegations that she raised in her State of Capture report in 2016. Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla said Zondo’s appointment and the commission were long overdue. “This is long overdue and we hope that Judge Raymond Zondo will be given all the necessary support to get to the bottom of the former public protector’s report,” Pamla said. Pamla said, as Cosatu, they hoped the inquiry would dig deeper and expose the decay that had crippled both the economy and the country. “Cosatu wants to see all the robber barons, swindlers and their enablers, who have stolen from the poor, sent to jail, where they belong.” -TNA Reporter
