A body of a 6-month-old girl was recovered from the Msunduzi River near Woodhouse Road in Pietermaritzburg. The recovery of the baby comes after ER24 paramedics, along with the SAPS Search and Rescue and K9 Unit, received information that a child had been dumped by a woman. “A search by the SAPS Search and Rescue divers immediately began on late Tuesday. Unfortunately, the search was called off but continued later on Wednesday,” said ER24 Spokesperson Russel Meiring. Meiring added that after several hours of searching, the body of a 6-month-old girl was found. Sadly, the child had been dead for some time. The mother of the baby has not been found and the incident is being investigated by the SAPS. -TNA Reporter
