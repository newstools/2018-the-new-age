Police Minister Fikile Mbalula says the country is dealing with serious violent crimes, organised crimes and corruption in the public and private sectors. He says that this requires that the head of DPCI be alive to the complexity of the 21st Century criminality. “We need a technologically savvy criminal justice system that refuses to live side by side with a crime.” Mbalula revealed that the police ministry will be making changes in the structure of the department, introducing the regionalisation plan. He said they will be reducing costs through a process of de-escalating top-tier management to the newly drawn boundaries in a regionalisation plan that will compliment the work of provincial commissioners. “From the 1st of February, starting from Gauteng we will have regional commissioners to disturb, disrupt and erupt crime in a systematic way.” -TNA Reporter
