Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi is on a drive to get rid of the remaining 21 asbestos schools in the province. Lesufi, together with infrastructure development MEC Jacob Mamabolo, officially opened the newly constructed Everest Primary School in Westbury, Johannesburg, to mark the first day back at school on Wednesday. Everest Primary School was one of 22 asbestos schools in the province. The department announced that plans were in place to rebuild the remaining 21. Lesufi said the school was part of the 42 new schools that had been built in the province and said the department would continue building a new school every month until 2019. “I am proud to say that we had 21 schools that were built with asbestos and we take responsibility for that. By the time we leave office, all the 21 schools asbestos will be eradicated,” he said. The school, which cost about R97m to build, is a full ICT school with smart classrooms, multipurpose sports fields, nutrition facilities and a dining hall. “We have already appointed a contractor for Noordgesig Primary School to build a school like this one,” Lesufi said. The department of infrastructure said that together with the department of education, they had been delivering a school a month for the past two years. Lesufi pleaded with the community of Westbury to take good care of the school, urging angry protesters to stay away from schools. “If you are angry and protesting, please leave these schools alone. You burn down or vandalise this school, it will be the end. We will not take money from somewhere else and put it towards those problems,” he said. Meanwhile, the department is still trying to determine the cost of repairs for the damage caused by a fire at Erasmia Primary School after the library was gutted by fire on Monday. “The initial report is that the fire at the school was caused by an electrical fault,” Lesufi said. shonisanit@thenewage.co.za
