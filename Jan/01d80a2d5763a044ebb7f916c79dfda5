The Western Cape High Court has declared the Gathering Act unconstitutional after 10 Social Justice Coalition (SJC) activists were arrested for picketing outside city of Cape Town Mayor Patricia De Lille’s office. The picketers had chained themselves to the railings of the Cape Town Civic Centre in a peaceful and organised act of civil disobedience. The historic judgment ruled that section 12 (1) (a) of the Gatherings Act is unconstitutional because it limits and criminalises peaceful protests. The ruling does not affect previous convictions under the Gatherings Act and any future contraventions of the act will result in fines rather than an arrest and criminal record. The judgment said: “The criminalisation of a gathering of more than 15 on the basis that no notice was given violates 17 of the Constitution as it deters people from exercising their fundamental right to assemble peacefully unarmed… The limitation is not reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society, based on the values of freedom, dignity and equality…Section 12 (1) (a) of the RGA is hereby declared unconstitutional.” Phumeza Mlungwana, who was part of the 10 arrested activists, said the ruling would allow protesters to make government aware of their plight in a peaceful protest. “Personally, we feel great that we don’t have a criminal record but it is a victory for other organisers and communities that use protests as a means of holding government to account to not feel like they are criminalised for participating in a peaceful protest,” Mlungwana said. -TNA Reporter
