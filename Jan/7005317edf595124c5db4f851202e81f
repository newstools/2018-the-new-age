The ANC Women’s League (ANCWL) has congratulated struggle veteran Winnie Madikizela-Mandela for being awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Laws during the 68th Graduation of Makerere University in Uganda. “Winnie remains an epitome of selfless servant-hood and she is accorded the respect she deserves by those who have appreciation of her outstanding contribution to the fight against apartheid and colonialism,” the ANCWL said. Madikizela-Mandela was awarded for the role she played during the struggle against apartheid. The ANCWL said Madikizela-Mandela dedicated her entire life to the liberation struggle and was never deterred by the physical and psychological tortures she endured from the apartheid machinery. The graduation ceremony was held on Friday at Makerere University in Uganda. The Honorary Doctorate was reportedly received on her behalf by her niece Gandhi Baai. “Cde Winnie’s resilience against patriarchy and male chauvinism that regards women as second class citizens, motivates many women in and outside the African National Congress to continue working without motives of material advantage or personal gain.” -TNA Reporter
