THE new look South African power utility Eskom’s 2021 dollar-denominated Eurobond rose to a two and a half month high yesterday after a new board, led by businessman Jabu Mabuza, was appointed. The Eurobond is a special type of bond issued in a currency which is different from the currency of the country or the market in which the bond is issued. Eurobonds give issuers the opportunity to take advantage of favourable regulatory and lending conditions in other countries as they are not usually subject to taxes or regulations of any one government, which can make it cheaper to borrow in the Eurobond markets as compared to other debt markets. Eskom’s 2021 issue was up 1.4 cents to trade at $100.9 (R1 200), according to Tradeweb data, its highest since early November. State-run Eskom has been in a leadership crisis after several board members, including the chairman and chief executive, resigned in 2017 amid growing governance concerns. Analysts said they saw the appointments as part of the reform promised by new ruling party head Cyril Ramaphosa. Some analysts said if further strength is likely, and substantial inroads are made to resolve the crisis at Eskom by eradicating any chance of default on the utility’s looming debt payments it is likely that it Eurobond will surprised on the upside. The Eurobond market is made up of investors, banks, borrowers, and trading agents that buy, sell, and transfer Eurobonds. business@thenewage.co.za
