City of Johannesburg environmental health practitioners have discovered strains of Listeria at a food outlet. Samples have been taken to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), for tests. Mpho Phalatse, a member of the mayoral committee for health and social development, has urged residents not to panic but to be vigilant and adhere to food safety guidelines. “We are awaiting lab confirmation of whether or not this is a disease-causing strain of the organism. Results should be back in the next 24 to 48 hours. “In the meantime, residents should continue adhering to food safety guidelines and report to their nearest clinic if they experience any symptoms associated with the disease,” Phalatse said. City of Johannesburg environmental health inspectors have also instructed that premises identified as “high risk” be sanitised while tests are underway. As of 16 January, a total of 764 Listeriosis cases have been reported around the country, with Johannesburg reporting 212 cases. Phalatse said her department would continue with awareness campaigns to educate the public about the dangers of Listeriosis. -TNA Reporter
