City of Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba has called on residents of the city to make use of the fraud line which was formed to report all forms of corruption in the city. The call comes after the suspension of two employees who worked for the City’s Group Finance Department for allegedly transferring R800 000 to a company of attorneys. According to Mashaba, the two were part of a syndicate of internal and external individuals, who swindled money from a customer’s account to an attorney’s trust account before requesting the payment thereafter. He says his administration’s priority has been the recovery of the money from the attorneys. “We will be laying criminal charges against both the internal and external individuals in this syndicate and ensure that everyone involved faces the full might of the law. “I am disappointed to learn that there are officials who are still involved in and engaged in corrupt activities. This is despite the fact that we continually educate employees about fraud and corruption, and despite the fact that we have made it clear that corruption will not be tolerated in the City of Johannesburg.” Mashaba added that they will continue to vigorously pursue every allegation of corruption in collaboration with institutions such as the Hawks and other organizations within the criminal justice system. “For years, shameless outright looting was the norm in Johannesburg. Corruption does not just steal from the City. It robs residents of much-needed services and resources. This is why corruption has no place in this administration and we will work tirelessly to eradicate it.” He urged anyone who wishes to report corruption to contact the fraud hotline on 0800 002 587 or visit the GFIS offices situated at 48 Ameshoff Street in Braamfontein. -TNA Reporter
