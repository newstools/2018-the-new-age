DA leader Mmusi Maimane has written to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete, requesting that this year’s State of the Nation Address (Sona) be postponed until President Jacob Zuma has been removed from office and a new president is elected. This year’s Sona is scheduled to take place next Thursday. “As things stand, it would not be in the best interests of South Africa for Zuma to deliver the Sona when there exists great uncertainty as to whether he will remain president, and if so, for how long,” Maimane said in a statement. “While the ANC’s National Working Committee has requested Zuma be removed before Sona, the ANC’s Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte has gone on record saying Zuma is ‘going nowhere’.” The DA leader said Mbete must act in the interests of all South Africans and postpone the Sona until the ANC leadership battle had been resolved. I have written to Speaker Mbete, requesting that #SONA2018 be postponed until Zuma has been removed from office, and Parliament votes to elect a new President. Last year’s SONA cost R11 million. Why spend that kind of money on a President that won’t be around much longer? pic.twitter.com/RyCiIM8r45 — Mmusi Maimane (@MmusiMaimane) January 31, 2018 MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE Meanwhile, the EFF has also written to Mbete to call for a motion of no confidence debate in the president before the Sona. EFF leader Julius Malema has reportedly warned that if the motion is not scheduled before the Sona, his party will raise the matter during the address. OPPOSITION MEETING At the same time, UDM leader Bantu Holomisa has extended an invitation to members of opposition parties to meet on Friday to discuss a range of issues, including next week’s Sona and the EFF’s call for a motion of no confidence. -TNA Reporter
