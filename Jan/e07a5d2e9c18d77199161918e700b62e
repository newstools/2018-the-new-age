ANC Treasurer General Paul Mashatile says there are going to be more changes under the new ANC leadership, lead by Cyril Ramaphosa. Mashatile is in Davos as part of the South African delegation representing the country at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Switzerland. This year’s event is held under the theme: “Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World.” “South Africa is ready for business and is under new leadership… There are going to be changes,” Mashatile said. The WEF presents South Africa with a platform to showcase its attractiveness as an investment destination and trade partner. Discussion platforms in Davos are to develop a response to new strategies towards transforming governance in various parts of the world. The South African team will put more emphasis on its plans to transform the economy, to ensure that its citizens enter new jobs and benefit from new investments attracted in partnership with business and organised labour. Among those who make the list are Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago, acting Transnet CEO Siyabonga Gama, Telkom Chair Jabu Mabuza and Investec CEO Stephen Koseff. The WEF annual meeting is expected to conclude on Friday 26 January. -TNA Reporter
