Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune believes his side is ready to take on league leaders Mamelodi Sundowns in an Absa Premiership encounter on Saturday at the FNB Stadium. Amakhosi will be looking to register a second win over Sundowns this season after they won 2-1 in the first round at Loftus Stadium. However, Chiefs skipper Khune is aware of the threats Sundowns will pose to his defence. “We are ready, the players are ready, we have to deliver the results “- Khune #KCPressCon #KCOneTeam #Amakhosi4Life — Kaizer Chiefs (@KaizerChiefs) January 24, 2018 “I will make sure my defenders take care of Brockie so that I won’t have to deal with him” – Khune #KCPressCon #KCOneTeam #Amakhosi4Life — Kaizer Chiefs (@KaizerChiefs) January 24, 2018 Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane told Khune not to worry about the newly signed striker Jeremy Brockie because he might not start with the match. “Itu you can rest, Brockie may not start. We did not bring him to put us on top. He found us there. We brought him for the Champions League. Brockie can help us in the continent.” – Mosimane #KCPressCon #KCOneTeam #Amakhosi4Life — Kaizer Chiefs (@KaizerChiefs) January 24, 2018 Mosimane said the Colombian forward Leonardo Castro who joined Chiefs in January transfer window from Sundowns might have given Steve Komphela their secrets. “Leo knows all our secrets, he travels with a booklet. He probably gave it to Steve” – Mosimane #KCPressCon #KCOneTeam #Amakhosi4Life — Kaizer Chiefs (@KaizerChiefs) January 24, 2018 The Brazilians are currently topping the table with 34 points from 18 games – four points clear of the second place Cape Town City. While Chiefs are third on the table with 29 points from 18 games. -TNA Reporter
