The Congress of South African Trade Union (Cosatu) in Nothern Cape will hold a meeting on Wednesday to discuss maladministration in both public and private sectors in the province. Provincial Secretary Anele Gxoyiya said Cosatu has identified departments that need for the MEC of Economic Development and Finance to establish forensic investigation on. “We are of the view that this process will help to identify and isolate individuals who are hell-bent on looting and leading the provincial government to bankruptcy.” Cosatu is of a view that urgent interventions need to be made in the province in order to improve financial accountability for sustained service delivery. “We will also engage with SAMWU to have a detailed analysis of the Auditor-General’s report on the state of the municipalities,” Gxoyiya said. During the meeting, the union will also focus on the investigations regarding illegal sales of taxi operation licenses and challenges that farm workers are faced with in the Northern Cape. “Our fight against corruption and maladministration will continue,” Gxoyiya added. -TNA Reporter
