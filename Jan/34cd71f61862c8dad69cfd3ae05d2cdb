Singer Musa Sukwene on Tuesday left many with tears flowing after he performed a moving tribute to late mega-producer Robbie Malinga. Sukwene performed his and Malinga’s hit-duet “Mthande” during Malinga’s funeral service held at the Rhema Bible Church in Johannesburg. Sukwene (a former Idols winner) had recently become the first ever artist signed to the Robbie Malinga Entertainment label. During his tribute, he thanked Malinga for having been a “mentor and a father” to him during the seven-year span of their relationship. “It’s hard having to start the new year this way, laying my brother to rest,” he said. Speaker after speaker heaped praise on Malinga for his musical mentorship as well as his sense of humour. -Siphiwe Mchunu
