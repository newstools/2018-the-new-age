LIMPING power utility Eskom yesterday confirmed that it had reinstated senior executives Matshela Koko and Perish Govender after they were cleared of any wrongdoing. Koko faced a disciplinary hearing over allegedly not declaring a conflict of interest while his stepdaughter Koketso Choma was a director at Impulse International, a firm which benefited from approximately R1bn worth of contracts awarded by Eskom. However, Eskom said Koko will resume duties as head of generation on Monday and Govender returned as acting head of group capital. “They have been cleared of any wrongdoing,” Eskom’s spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said. The two successfully fought off charges laid against them during separate disciplinary hearings. “Following two separate appeals that were being undertaken on Koko and Govender, both have been reinstated,” Phasiwe said. Govender was identified as someone who played a central role in the Trillian debacle which also involved consulting firm McKinsey. The firm admitted last year that it made mistakes while working with Trillian and Eskom. Koko has also been cleared of any wrongdoing after being accused of awarding contracts to a company linked to his stepdaughter. -TNA REPORTER
