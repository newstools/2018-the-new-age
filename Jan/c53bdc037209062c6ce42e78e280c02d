AMERICAN rap and fashion mogul P Diddy is reportedly looking to offer the child model who featured in H&M’s racist ad campaign a $1m dollar (R12.4m) modelling contract for his fashion brand, Sean John. Yesterday, British tabloid The Metro said it had confirmed the entertainer was looking to offer the unknown young model a million dollar deal. The news comes after criticism of racism took hold of social media in response to the retailer publishing a picture of the young model clad in a hooded jacket with print that read “coolest monkey in the jungle”. Though the company said it was “deeply sorry that the picture was taken” and that “routines were not followed properly” before it was published on its online store, critics – including celebrities – continued to speak out on social media with some having already announced their disassociation with the store. At the height of the controversy as local and international stars spoke out against the advert, P Diddy was one of those who strongly spoke out against the Swedish retail store. “Put some respect on it!! When you look at us make sure you see royalty and supernatural God sent glory!! Anything else is disrespectful,” he said on Instagram. siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
