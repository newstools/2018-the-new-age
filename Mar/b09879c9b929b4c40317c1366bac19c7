IMAX today released a new featurette that takes fans on a larger-than-life look back at the Marvel films that have exhilarated IMAX moviegoers in the lead up to Avengers: Infinity War. From the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor to Black Panther, Captain America, Doctor Strange, and more, IMAX audiences have experienced Marvel’s most epic superhero battles and adventures in a truly immersive way. Next month, Marvel and IMAX take things to the next level by making cinema history with Marvel Studios’ Avengers: Infinity War, which marks the first Hollywood film ever to be shot entirely using IMAX cameras. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo designed Avengers: Infinity War for IMAX. In addition to it being filmed entirely using IMAX cameras, the movie will be presented in IMAX’s expanded 1.9:1 aspect ratio. Only in IMAX theatres will the movie expand vertically to show up to 26% more of the image than standard theatres – providing IMAX fans with even greater scope and immersion. The ALEXA IMAX 65mm camera is a next-generation revolutionary 2D digital camera developed through a partnership between ARRI and IMAX for use by today’s leading filmmakers working in the IMAX® format. The camera, when combined with IMAX’s digital re-mastering process, delivers the highest level of digital image capture and playback resulting in stunning lifelike images with pristine clarity, incredibly fine detail, vivid colors and a higher dynamic range for superior contrast. This camera is no stranger to the world of superheroes as it was first used by the Russo Brothers to shoot the airport battle sequence of Marvel’s Captain America: Civil War, released in May 2016. -TNA Reporter
