North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo has thanked the standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) in the province for giving his office an opportunity to account for more than R100 million in irregular expenditure. Mahumapelo and his officials were on Tuesday questioned over the awarding of tenders without competitive bids and payments that could not be substantiated by his office. Provincial director-general Lydia Sebego was asked about concerns raised by the Auditor General in his 2016-17 financial year audit report. Among some of his concerns, the Auditor General said the department had made payments of more than R112 million in contravention of the supply chain management requirements which were not included in the irregular expenditure. The premier and his provincial leadership have in recent times been involved in allegations of corruption and mismanagement of funds including the department of health’s prepayment of R30 million to Gupta-linked company Mediosa for a mobile clinic before the company even started to do work. A Mpumalanga-based company was also given a prepayment of R103 million to fix roads damaged by floods across the province last year. Last week, Mahumapelo was involved in a spat with Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi after he criticised the provincial department for its prepayment to Mediosa. -TNA Reporter
