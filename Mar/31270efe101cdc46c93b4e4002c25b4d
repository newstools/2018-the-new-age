THE case of former acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane was postponed to June 7, after he made a brief appearance yesterday in the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court. Phahlane, his wife Brig Beauty Phahlane and car dealer Durandt Synman are facing charges of corruption and fraud committed while he was employed as the divisional commissioner of the SAPS forensic services. The state handed over the docket to defence while further pre-trial matters need to be settled. In addition, more witnesses could take the stand in court before the next appearance date. This is in relation to alleged kickbacks that Phahlane received for awarding tenders. The former police boss and his wife are accused of having received vehicles from Snyman. All accused were granted bail of R10000 each in February. In an exclusive interview with The New Age earlier this year, Phahlane denied allegations in relation to an R80000 home theatre system, allegedly paid for by businessman John Henry Deale, whose company was reportedly awarded a R50m contract to supply the police department with equipment used for investigations. He claimed to have paid the bill himself. Phahlane was suspended last year after he was accused of fraud and corruption for illegally awarding tenders. keitumetsim@thenewage.co.za -KEITUMETSI MOTLHALE
