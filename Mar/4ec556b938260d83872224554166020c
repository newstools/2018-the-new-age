The Zimbabwean Border will be closed down from the 16th to 17th April 2018 due to protests that will be led by International Cross-Border Traders Association advises cross-border traders (ICTA). ICTA President Denis Juru urged all truck, bus, taxi drivers, clearing agents and travellers to join them on the protest. “This serves to notify travellers that on the 16th and 17th of April 2018 all borders to and from Zimbabwe shall be disrupted by protests. “The International Cross-Border Traders Association advises cross-border traders, truck drivers, bus drivers, taxi drivers, clearing agents, travellers and cross-border traders to heed our call,” said Juru. The ICTA will be protesting to Zimra and Border Control at Mwenezi for allegedly being asked for bribery at the border by greedy officials. Among other things that they will be protesting about is stopping of researching travellers who have documents showing that they have been searched already at Beitbridge border post. They also demand the abolishment of the SI64 of 2016 which prohibits the importation of basic commodities that are even not on shelves in Zimbabwean shops. “If Zimbabwe is open for business as said by the President, allow Zimbabweans to import any goods of their choice or groceries for personal consumption.” -TNA Reporter
