The iconic Afro-soul vocalist Ringo Mandlingozi will perform an electric mix of soul-soothing sounds at the Ekhuruleni Comes to Alive Jazz Evening, taking place at Birchwood Hotel in Boksburg on Friday. Madlingozi will be joined by multi-nominated SAMA award group The Muffinz and the upcoming local acapella group Uncunthu The Firm-Africa. Madlingozi has accumulated a number of awards over the years, including Best Male Vocalist at the Samas, Best Male Artist (Southern Africa) and Best Male Vocalist (African Continent) at the Kora awards. Urban House Media spokesperson Tegan Mitcell said Madlingozi will be headlining the evening with his inspirational and spiritual rhythms. “The Muffinz whose music is best described as a fusion of a variety of genres will be supporting Ringo.” The evening will be opened by Uncunthu The Firm-Africa. “Comedians Schoolboy and Chik Aljoy guarantee to have guests entertained with their much-loved humour.” -TNA Reporter
