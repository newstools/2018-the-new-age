KwaZulu-Natal MEC For transport, community safety and liaison Mxolisi Kaunda has called for stringent safety measures following a shocking crash that claimed nine lives in Helpmekaar near Ladysmith on Sunday. It is reported that a minibus collided with a bakkie, leaving nine passengers dead upon impact. “Six people are in a critical state and four escaped with minor injuries and they were all transported to Ladysmith Provincial Hospital to receive medical and trauma care,” Kaunda said. Kaunda instructed a team of forensic experts to fast-track investigations into the real cause of the crash. “It is deeply saddening to learn of such a dreadful crash that has claimed the lives of nine people and left others critically injured. Again, this crash could have been avoided if road and traffic rules were observed by the drivers.” The call for more stringent enforcement measures comes as law officials prepare for the upcoming Easter weekend. “We are further calling for a more united front from all spheres of society to curb road crashes and fatalities, as well as a change of mindsets and driver patterns on the road. On behalf of the provincial government of KwaZulu-Natal, we wish to send our heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of the deceased and wish those in hospital a speedy recovery.” -TNA Reporter
