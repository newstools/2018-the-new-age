Deputy President David Mabuza will on Monday respond to questions in Parliament. It will the first time that Mabuza responds to oral questions since he was appointed deputy president by President Cyril Ramaphosa. By virtue of being the deputy president, he also assumes the responsibility of being the leader of government business and the moral regeneration, which among other things includes keeping ministers in line and ensuring that they are accountable. Earlier this month, National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete wrote to Mabuza to deal with ministers who were not appearing in Parliament to answer questions from MPs following the absence of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba and Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Lindiwe Sisulu. Mabuza also reappointed veteran ANC MP and former President Jacob Zuma’s parliamentary councilor Ibrahim Ibrahim. Last week, Ramaphosa also answered questions in Parliament for the first time as president of the country. -TNA Reporter
