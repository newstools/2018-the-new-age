The Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court has on Friday set 30 July as the trial date for For students activist Mcebo Dlamini. Dlamini appeared in a court in relations to the 2016 Fees Must Fall student protests. He is facing charges ranging from court violation, public violence, assault, theft, and malicious damage to property. Dlamini has been in and out of court in the past years since the fees must fall protest. In January prosecutor Steven Rubin told the court that the case was previously postponed because of the discovery of video footage. Early last year Dlamini allegedly insulted former cabinet spokesperson Mzwanele Manyi, in a WhatsApp group. He had since denied insulting him, saying that he only learned of that through social media networks. At the time, Manyi described the message as “absolute rubbish” saying that he had instructed his lawyers to handle the “defamatory and character assassination assault”. -TNA Reporter
