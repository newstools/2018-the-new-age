ANN7 management and religious leader Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng, have agreed to work together to launch a new hour-long gospel show to be hosted by Mboro. The show aims to focus on healing, uplifting people’s lives and encouraging the spirit of nation building with the word of God and viewers can expect an engaging show every Sunday this week on ANN7 (DStv 405). The channel said that following a delay in the launch of the show, a “successful and progressive meeting” with the pastor was held and all outstanding issues about the show were finalised. “We have agreed that there was a breakdown of communication. Matters were clarified and contextualised and we agreed to share further documentary evidence to corroborate this explanation,” ANN7 said in a statement. At the weekend Mboro had cited issues over the channel’s ownership as reasons for the launch of the much publicised television programme. “I felt there were a lot of things that had to be sorted with the station. A lot of people have been calling my office asking why I am not appearing on air,” Mboro said. -TNA Reporter
