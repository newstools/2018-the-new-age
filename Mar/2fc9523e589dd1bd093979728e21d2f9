Former ANC communications manager Khusela Diko has been appointed spokesperson to President Cyril Ramaphosa. “Ms Diko is a seasoned communicator and marketing professional who was, until recently, the governing party’s National Communications Manager and acted as its spokesperson on many occasions. Prior to joining the ANC, she served as Chief Director of Communications in the Gauteng Provincial Government,” the presidency said in a statement. This comes after the party announced her departure on Thursday during a media briefing. The party thanked her for leading the party’s Department of Information and Publicity (DIP) diligently during her time in office. “Comrade Khusela has selflessly led the department with diligence and commitment. We thank her for service to the ANC and wish her well in her future endeavors. We are confident that she is not lost to the overall communications machinery of the ANC,” the party said. Diko serves in the highest decision making structures of the ANC in Gauteng as a member of both the Provincial Executive Committee and the Provincial Working Committee. She holds a Bachelor of Commerce degree and is currently studying for a Bachelor of Laws degree. Meanwhile, the ANC appointed Donovan Cloete as the acting communication manager. “The ANC has appointed Comrade Donovan Cloete as an Acting National Manager in the Department of Information and Publicity with immediate effect. “With vast experience in the Communications industry, the ANC is confident that Comrade Donovan will keep the unit intact and effective. We wish him well in the execution of his duties,” the ANC said. -TNA Reporter
