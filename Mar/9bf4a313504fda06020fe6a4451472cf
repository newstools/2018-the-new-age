THE Minister of International Relations, Lindiwe Sisulu, has rejected news reports that she had absented herself from the National Assembly last Wednesday without having informed Speaker Baleka Mbete. Sisulu and the Minister of Home Affairs, Malusi Gigaba, were due to appear in the National Assembly as part of the Cabinet’s Security Cluster to answer questions related to their portfolios. Their absence from the sitting angered opposition parties. Mbete informed the chamber on Wednesday that neither Sisulu nor Gigaba had informed her before the sitting had begun that they would be absent. The following day Mbete told the National Assembly she shared concerns that ministers were not in the house to respond to questions as scheduled. Therefore, she had written to the Leader of Government Business, Deputy President David Mabuza, “to appeal to him that ministers are able to carry out their obligations in the National Assembly”. Sisulu’s ministry has clarified her absence in a statement. “The Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation has noted with concern misleading media reports that Hon Minister Sisulu, MP, did not offer an apology to Parliament for being unable to attend the oral question to the Peace and Security Cluster session on Wednesday, March 7. “We would like to put on record that the minister submitted her letter of apology to the speaker, that the letter was indeed acknowledged and on that basis of an apology the Deputy Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Hon Luwellyn Landers, MP, was allowed to respond to questions on behalf of the minister,” the statement said. news@thenewage.co.za -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
