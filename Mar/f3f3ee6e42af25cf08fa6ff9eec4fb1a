Former President Jacob Zuma is reportedly being investigated by the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) for allegedly receiving an R1 million bribe from an abalone dealer in the Western Cape. This is according to a report by the City Press. According to the report, the bribe was to ensure that a cabinet minister named by the paper who was also an Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister did not leave his post. The paper is also reporting that according to an affidavit that was forwarded to the police in Pretoria, a named union leader and another agriculture department deputy director-general each also received an R300 000 bribe from the same businessman. Efforts to get the Hawks to comment were unsuccessful. In response to the latest allegations against Zuma, Saft’s President Zwelinzima Vavi wrote on Twitter: If this is true my x President and friend Sidumo Dlamini will remember that he pioneered two forensic audits to try find dirt on me after he believed his own propaganda that I have stolen millions and abused COSATU credit card. They found nothing! @News24 https://t.co/V0Faq8yi0t — Zwelinzima Vavi (@Zwelinzima1) March 25, 2018 Meanwhile , the National Director of Public Prosecutions recently also reinstated the fraud and corruption charges against Zuma.
