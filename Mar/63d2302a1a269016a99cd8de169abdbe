Metrorail Gauteng on Wednesday announced train services between Koedoespoort and Pienaarspoort stations in Pretoria had been suspended. Spokesperson Lillian Mofokeng said the decision to suspend the train service was due to violence, attacks on train drivers and damage to newly rolled out trains. “At least six new trains have been withdrawn because of vandalism. There were several trains that were vandalised, windscreens were shattered with stones,” Mofokeng said. Mofokeng also stated that 10 employees were attacked in less than a week, with the latest incident taking place on Tuesday at the Eerste Fabrieke station. “We cannot risk any other life, we cannot continue like this.” Metrorail said that there would be no alternative plans for commuters and commuters with valid tickets for the month or weekly tickets could claim refunds. -TNA Reporter
