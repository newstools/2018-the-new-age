Former President Thabo Mbeki has distanced himself from announcement by the ANC that he and two other former presidents will join the ANC’s campaign leading up to the 2019 elections. The Thabo Mbeki Foundation said it was alerted to the information through media reports. On Saturday, the ANC announced that former leaders Mbeki, Jacob Zuma and Kgalema Motlanthe would campaign for the party leading up to the 2019 polls. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe told the media that the three former heads of state would start attending party events and would be expected to work with the party on matters relating to political education. Thabo Mbeki Foundation head of communication Thami Ntenteni said, at this stage, neither Mbeki’s office or the foundation had received an invitation to attend any election workshop. This is despite The Citizen newspaper on Sunday showing a letter dated 1 March, signed by ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule, informing Mbeki of a National Executive Committee (NEC) decision to invite him to take part in meetings, programmes and activities on the virtue of him being a former president and an ex-officio member. Ntenteni said the foundation had seen the letter in The Citizen newspaper but had not received it and have so far, not been contacted by the ANC. “As genuine as the letter may be, I wish to reiterate that it was never delivered to us,” Ntenteni said. He said once Mbeki received a proper invitation, he would assess it, as with all the invitations, and consider what decision he would deem necessary, depending on his schedule. “Mbeki is a disciplined member of the ANC in good standing and he is always willing to do work for the party.” -TNA Reporter
