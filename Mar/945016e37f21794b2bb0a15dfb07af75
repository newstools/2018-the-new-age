Limpopo Premier, Chupu Stanley Mathabatha has urged the citizens to utilise this year to redouble their efforts to advance the total socio-economic emancipation of women. Mathabatha said this ahead of the celebration of International Women’s Day. 2018 marks the centenary of the birth of anti-apartheid activist Albertina Sisulu who was described as a prominent leader. The Limpopo Provincial Government led by Mathabatha will celebrate International Women’s Day scheduled to take place at Nirvana Community Hall under the theme ”100 years of Albertina Sisulu, the Champion of Women Rights”. “International Women’s Day is a day to unite as a country and to also reflect on the achievements of women,” Mathabatha said. In reflecting on the achievements of women, the provincial government has appointed women in key strategic roles such as Heads of Departments and CEOs in government and State Owned Entities. During his State of the Province Address, Mathabatha encouraged the private sectors, non-government organisations and the civil society to celebrate the International Women’s Day by continuing to empower women with skills development programmes, appointment of women in managerial roles, job and entrepreneurship opportunities. -TNA Reporter
