The EFF has promised to vote for an ANC mayoral candidate in Nelson Mandela Bay in the Eastern Cape, only if it puts forward former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas as its candidate. The party said it wants Jonas as a mayoral candidate because of his commitment to clean governance. Jonas recently resigned as an ANC member of Parliament. EFF leader Julius Malema spoke during the party’s march for good public healthcare at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto on Wednesday. Malema announced on Tuesday, while introducing a motion on the expropriation of land without compensation, that as a warning shot to the DA, the party would be instructing its leadership to prepare a no-confidence motion against Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Athol Trollip. Malema said Jonas’s refusal to take a R600 million bribe from the Guptas was a sign that he could be trusted. “The ANC has punished Mcebisi Jonas for rejecting R600 million, by not electing him in their confidence or appointing him as a minister now,” Malema said. Malema said the EFF’s cooperation with the DA in Tshwane and Johannesburg was going well but warned that the same would be done if the DA was being disrespectable. Meanwhile, the ANC in the province announced that its doors were open for discussions with the EFF on a possible coalition government for Nelson Mandela Bay. ANC Chairperson in the province Oscar Mabuyane told the SABC that the move would serve the best interests of the people of the metro. “Yes, we are definitely looking forward to this offer but it is not really a formal offer because we read about it on social media. But, if it comes, it is something worth considering, working with other political parties,” Mabuyane said. “We have been cocoordinating, it is what we call a black caucus, in that space and found that that area is not properly governed, it is not properly led.” -TNA Reporter
