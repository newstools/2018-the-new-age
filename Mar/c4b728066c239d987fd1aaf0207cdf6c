The EFF in the Free State on Thursday said the appointment of Sisi Ntombela as the premier was a continuation of the deterioration and rot within the ruling party. EFF leader in the province Kgotso Morapela said Ntombela‘s appointment should serve as a wake up call to all those who hoped the election of Cyril Ramaphosa as president was the beginning of a change in the ANC. “Yes, we are vindicated for taking a clear stance when everyone was ululating and celebrating fake unity and the renewal of the ANC after Nazrec – that was all just a big farce. In fact, the sooner the people of the Free State realise that it is still business as usual, the better,” Morapela said. “Under Sisi Ntombela’s premiership, corruption under Operation Hlasela is going to continue, nepotism and dishing of patronage coupled with poor service delivery, sky-high unemployment, squalor and poverty are going to continue unabated because she is just a mere extension of Ace Magashule.” Ntombela was announced on Wednesday as the premier-elect of the province by the ANC’s Secretary-General and outgoing premier Ace Magashule at Luthuli House in Johannesburg. She is currently Deputy President of the ANC Women’s League and provincial MEC for human settlements. During a briefing on Wednesday, Ntombela thanked the organisation for putting its faith in her, adding that things would not be easy going forward. She said all ANC deployees derived their mandate from the 54th National Congress, pledging that she would also concentrate on delivering on the mandate. “The important mandate is to unite ANC members. So, I am going to try my level best to unite the Free Staters,” the newly premier-elect said. -TNA Reporter
