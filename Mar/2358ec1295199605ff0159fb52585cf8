As the community of Mpumalanga continues to seek justice following the murder of two children, Mpumalanga SAPS on Wednesday announced that three more suspects have been arrested. It follows the killing of 13-year-old Gabisile Shabani, who was living with albinism and her one-year-old cousin Nkosikhona Ngwenya who was “mistakenly” kidnapped from his home by armed robbers – who allegedly wanted his albino cousin of the same age. Shabani’s body was found buried in a shallow grave in Cullinan. Her head and some of her body parts were missing and it is reported that they were taken to Swaziland. Meanwhile, Ngwenya’s body was found near the N4 Highway outside Emalahleni. It is reported that the additional suspects are scheduled to appear before the Witbank Magistrate’s court on Wednesday. Thokozani Msibi,32, the alleged mastermind behind the kidnappings, was denied bail last week. The magistrate indicated that the case was very serious and the manner that the children were killed was brutal. The second suspect Mthobisi Brilliant Mkhize, 24, was expected to appear in court on Tuesday for a formal bail application but never appeared, as he awaits a state-funded lawyer. -TNA Reporter
