FOUR years after the collapse of the Tongaat Mall in the north of Durban that claimed two lives, another Durban building has collapsed, killing three construction workers and injuring five others. The latest incident happened on Chamberlain Road, south of Durban, yesterday afternoon. Eyewitnesses claim that the wall of the building fell on the workers. The cause of the building’s collapse was unclear at the time of going to print as were the names of the construction company and the owner of the building which was being constructed. Names of the deceased and injured workers had also not been released at the time as the next of kin were still being sought. However, it was gathered that most of the victims were in Durban just for work purposes. Eyewitnesses said some of the trapped workers died instantly while those who were trapped and rescued suffered serious injuries. Witnesses said there was pandemonium as some people from nearby buildings rushed to help while others were just shell-shocked and watched from a distance. KZN Emergency Rescue Services spokesperson Robert Mackenzie, speaking from the scene, said by 3pm yesterday, there were three confirmed deaths and five serious injuries. Complicating the matter was that Mackenzie claimed that the wall fell and crushed to death people who were on the back of a truck that had a load on it. “The rescuers say there are three fatalities. There were also five injured people with one person suffering critical injuries with the other four people sustaining serious injuries and transported to hospital,” Mackenzie said. sihlem@thenewage.co.za
