The Department of Education in Western Cape has confirmed that it is investigating allegations of sexual misconduct against a staff member at the Fairmont Secondary School in Grassy Park, Cape Town. This comes after the emergence of pictures and videos of a male administrative staff member in compromising positions with female students. In the pictures circulating on social, the man is seen with girls believed to be from the school. In some of these pictures, various girls are in their school uniform in suggestive poses. The provincial Education Department spokesperson Millicent Merton said that the department took this incident in a significant manner. “The Western Cape Education Department views these allegations in a very serious light and we are busy with the investigation,” she said. Merton could not divulge the numbers of girls involved in the incident as investigations are continuing. She also clarified that the individual involved in this matter was not a teacher as it was initially reported but an “administrative staff member”. Following the incident, the staff member has been suspended while investigations continue on the accusations of sexual misconduct against him. According to reports, the pictures came to light after some individual bought a flash drive from a drug addict who found the flash. -TNA Reporter
