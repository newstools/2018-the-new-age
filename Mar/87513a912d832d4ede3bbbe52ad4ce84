THE police task team is looking for three men in connection with the murder of an off-duty police constable who was gunned down in the early hours of Sunday. Const Bongani Moses Saliwe, 39, was shot at 4am in Mafora township near Bloemfontein. Police spokesperson Col Thandi Mbambo said Saliwe was stationed at Reddersburg police station, 68km south of Bloemfontein. Mbambo said the deceased was on his way home and just as he was about to drop off his neighbours, a couple, in JB Mafora dark BMW approached them and three men walked towards them while they were still in the car. “One of the men who was armed with a gun knocked on the window demanding Saliwe open and he refused,” Mbambo said. “The suspect demanded the fire arm of the deceased and when he refused, the perpetrator fired one shot which wounded Saliwe in the chest.” She said the suspect then searched the constable and took his service pistol. “Saliwe died on his way to hospital and the motive for the killing is still unknown at this stage,” Mbambo said. The acting police commissioner, Maj-Gen Thollie Afonso, said they couldn’t allow the police to be killed senselessly. “A loss of such a young dedicated member is one loss too many,” Afonso said. “We call on the community to assist with information that could lead to the arrest of these armed and dangerous perpetrators.” She said anyone with information should please contact Sgt Machalotsa on 073 729 1732. beckers@thenewage.co.za -BECKER SEMELA
