The seven hundred Prasa workers who were reinstated marched to the company’s head office to demand clarity on when they can resume work. The workers were reinstated after the Constitutional Court ruled in their favour in February. South African Federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi said the National Transport Movement (NTM) will meet with Prasa. Workers were fired by the rail agency five years ago, however, they won the case against Prasa. Prasa fired workers after it accused them of burning trains worth about R42 million during a wage strike. The workers are affiliated to the National Transport Movement. -TNA Reporter
