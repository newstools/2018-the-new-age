The ANC Youth League (ANCYL) in KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday said it would be supporting former President Jacob Zuma when he appeared in court to face charges. Last week, National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Shaun Abrahams announced he had decided to reinstate charges against Zuma after the Supreme Court of Appeal overturned former NDPP head Mokotedi Mpshe’s decision to set the charges aside. ANCYL provincial chairperson Kwazi Mshengu said the league had already started mobilising support for Zuma, for when he appeared in court, adding that as with any other citizen, Zuma should be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a court of law. Mshengu said the league respected the decision by the NPA to reinstate charges against Zuma and accepted that the power to prosecute lies with it. “Almost 12 years down the line, we see the revival of the charges and with the manner in which this case has been politicised, as you would know, that it was kept alive by opposition parties. We are confident that the courts will resist being drawn into a political football,” Mshengu told the SABC. He said the league was in touch with other provinces to ensure that the former president received the necessary support. “We are going to mobilise for him as we did almost 12 years ago. We are going to go all out to mobilise that people also come to support him during the days of the trial. As the ANCYL leadership, not only in KZN but we have been in touch with other provinces, including of the ANC, saying they are willing to come on board. We may also see the repeat of the support that we had before he became ANC president.” He said the league was happy with Zuma’s participation in the 2019 election campaign as they believed he would not cause any damage to the party’s chances. -TNA Reporter
