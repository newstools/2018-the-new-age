Darren Lehmann, coach of the scandal-tainted Australia cricket team, said Thursday he would quit after the fourth and final Test of a series in South Africa. “This will be my last Test as head coach of the Australian cricket team,” Lehmann told a press conference on the eve of the match. “Saying goodbye to the players was the toughest thing I have ever had to do.” -AFP
