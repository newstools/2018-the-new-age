Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba reacted with anger on Tuesday to accusations that he knew about what the Gupta family and their associates were doing at state-owned enterprises (SOEs) but kept quiet about it. The Chairperson of Parliament’s portfolio committee on public enterprises, Zukiswa Rantho, was forced to intervene when Gigaba and DA shadow minister of public enterprises Natasha Mazzone argued about his involvement during his time as minister of public enterprises. Gigaba is appearing before the committee which is investigating allegations of state capture at Eskom. “State capture happened under your nose. You should have raised the red flag and you did nothing to stop it,” Mazzone told Gigaba. Earlier in her cross-examination, Mazzone accused Gigaba of being one of former President Jacob Zuma’s favourite ministers, an accusation Gigaba denied. “Chairperson, I deny that I was a favourite minister for President Zuma. We must remember that I was not the first option for the post. There were some other people who were prepared ahead of me,” Gigaba said. Gigaba did however admit to attending several events organised by the Gupta family, including a Diwali festival but could not say why he was invited. -TNA Reporter
