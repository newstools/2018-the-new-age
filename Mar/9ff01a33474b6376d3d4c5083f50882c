Parliaments Higher Education and Training committee has welcomed the appointment of Prof Mamokgethi Phakeng as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cape Town (UCT) saying it addresses the under-representation of women in such high-level positions. “We look forward at our earliest convenience as a committee to engage with Prof Phakeng through our oversight responsibility over the university to address transformation challenges, culture at UCT – a place for all to feel welcome amongst others, contributing to the development agenda of South Africa and to produce students of high calibre,” the committee said in a statement on Tuesday. Phakeng takes over from Dr Max Price, who has been UCT’s vice-chancellor since 2008. The committee has wished Phakeng the best and has also urged all the university community to work with her to take the University to “even greater heights.” Reacting to her appointment, Phakeng said: “I am honoured to have been afforded an opportunity to lead one of the best institutions on the continent. “I am particularly humbled by the overwhelming support that I have received from the university community. “I know that the task that lies ahead is a mammoth one and I do not underestimate its complexities. “In every challenge we face, there are also opportunities and I also know that alongside all the members of the campus community, we will meet the challenges and reach even
higher milestones as an institution.” Phakeng is expected to formally take up her duties from July 1. -TNA Reporter
