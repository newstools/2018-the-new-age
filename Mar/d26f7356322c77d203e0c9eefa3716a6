Officials at the SABC are being accused of corruption over the issuing of R185 million worth of security tenders. According to reports, former SABC interim board chairperson Khanyisile Kweyama and other officials are being accused of corrupt conduct by certifying that security company Mjayeli Security, which lost its bid, was not further awarded the security contract. The allegations are being revealed in court over a R185 million security tender. IOL is reporting that the aggrieved losing bidder, Mjayeli Security, lost the tender to Mafoko Security, despite its bid being R2m cheaper than that of Mafoko Security. However, it further reports that the public broadcaster in court papers has, in turn, accused the losing bidder of collaborating with SABC to be favoured in the bidding process. While answering questions before Parliament’s portfolio committee on communications last week, SABC board Chairperson Bongumusa Makhatini said the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) was investigating the matter. “We are aware of the allegations and we are taking action to get them thoroughly investigated. So, the SIU is assisting us in investigating those allegations, so the matter is being attended to and we will brief you with further details on the matter,” Makhatini said. -TNA Reporter
