Former President Jacob Zuma is set to appear in the Durban High Court on 6 April to face charges of charges of fraud‚ corruption and racketeering, alongside French arms manufacturer Thint (now Thales). The charges relate to questionable payments which Zuma allegedly received during the government’s multibillion rand arms deal in 1996. The charges were reinstated by National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams after the Supreme Court of Appeal overturned a decision by former NPA head Mokotedi Mpshe to withdraw them in 2009, citing political interference in the case. The Hawks said summons are being finalised for the former president to appear in court next week as this is a priority case. -TNA Reporter
