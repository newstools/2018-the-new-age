International Relations Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has called on the international community not to panic over the parliamentary process on land reform. Sisulu on Sunday said she had noted a number of international organisations and individuals commenting on the parliamentary processes in South Africa relating to land distribution as proposed by the EFF and supported by ANC. Last week, EFF leader Julius Malema tabled a motion calling for the amendment of section 25 of the Constitution to enable the expropriation of land without compensation. Sisulu said President Cyril Ramaphosa had already spoken in Parliament and on a number of public platforms saying there was no need to panic and that the matter was being handled properly for the benefit of all South Africans. “There is a parliamentary process underway and all stakeholders, domestic and international, must respect that process and also take advantage of that process to make their input. The president remains committed to engaging all stakeholders during this process,” Sisulu said. Sisulu said the international community played an important role in the fight against apartheid and all its repressive and discriminatory policies. “We invite members of the international community to continue supporting our efforts to reverse the legacy of apartheid.” -TNA Reporter
