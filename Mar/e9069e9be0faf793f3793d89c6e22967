Sanco has welcomed and saluted the two life terms sentences given to a Danish national Peter Frederiksen for rape and conspiracy to commit murder. Following the sentencing at the Free State High Court on Thursday, Sanco said it welcomes the removal of the worst psychotic monster and perpetrator of heinous atrocities against women that the world has ever seen. Frederiksen was arrested in September, 17, 2015 at his home in Langenhoven Park, Bloemfontein and was investigated for the murder of his wife who was short outside her home in Lesotho. According to the NPA regional spokesperson Pheladi Shuping the convict was given an addition of 52 years in jail for charges including assault, loss of firearm, conveyance and possession of unregistered medication and production of child pornography. “He initially faced 58 charges at the beginning of his trial but Judge Johann Daffue dropped 20 charges related to illegally removing human tissues over technicality as the National Health Act does not clearly indicate the nature of penalties that should be imposed to any person who contravenes the act,” Shuping said. Sanco national spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu expressed disappointment over the convict not prosecuted for the human tissue removal, following the discovery of 21 clitorises in his freezer. “We believe that the sentence has somehow robbed families of some his victims of closure, and the technicality on which most serious charges against him were dropped is a travesty of justice for victims of sexual violence,” Mahlangu. Mahlangu emphasised that his inhumane treatment of women and regard of them as objects of sadism was unparalleled. -TNA Reporter
