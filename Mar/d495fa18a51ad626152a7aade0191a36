Vele Investment has on Tuesday asked the court to urgently set aside the decision taken by the South African Reserve bank (Sarb) to put VSB Mutual bank under curatorship. Vele Investment owns 58% of VBS bank. It argues that it had approached PIC for a R1.5bn loan and was to receive an answer on March 15, but effectively sabotaged the bankâ€™s efforts by announcing the curatorship on Sunday March 14. In effect this meant that the bank was not able to solve its liquidity problems and the curatorship has amplified prospects of a run on the bank.
Sarb announced on Sunday that it is putting VSB under curatorship after National Treasury instructed municipalities to stop investing with the bank. Municipalities withdrew about R1 billion from the cash-struck bank. -TNA Reporter
