The Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has made a commitment to amend the Tobacco legislation of 2005. At the 17th World Tobacco Conference on Wednesday, Motsoaledi said the legislation adjustments are in the pipelines. He has promised to make much stricter legislation governing tobacco. “When the legislation was passed in 2005 we compromised because there was a lot of resistance,” said Motsoaledi. He added that the country will change the tobacco packaging to ensure that the product is less appealing to young people. It is reported that 7 million people die of the product’s related diseases annually around the world. Motsoaledi said that the 25% space for smokers in public and hospitals will be abolished. -TNA Reporter
