North West murder accused, farmers Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte, are expected to appear in the North West High Court in Mahikeng on Thursday. The two are accused of the murder of 16-year-old Matlhomola Mosweu in Coligny in April 2017. During their previous court appearance on Tuesday, both accused pleaded not guilty on charges of murder, intimidation, kidnapping, unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, theft and pointing of a firearm. They are alleged to have apprehended Mosweu on the accusation that he stole a sunflower from their farm. According to the farmers, they had placed the teenager at the back of their bakkie with the intention to report him to the police. The teenager allegedly then jumped out of the moving vehicle, leading to injuries to his neck. Mosweu later died on his way to a hospital. Meanwhile, in testimony given to the court on Tuesday, specialist forensic pathologist Dr Ruweida Moorad reportedly revealed to the court that the teenager’s cause of death was as a result of “blunt force neck trauma”. The farmers are currently out on a bail of R5 000 each. -TNA Reporter
