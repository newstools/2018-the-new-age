DA shadow minister of justice and constitutional development Glynnis Breytenbach on Thursday said the party was keenly awaiting a decision by National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Shaun Abrahams on whether former President Jacob Zuma would stand trial for corruption. Breytenbach said Abrahams had run out of ways to delay his decision on the matter and the DA’s nine-year battle to have the charges against Zuma reinstated had finally come to head. Abrahams is expected to announce soon whether Zuma will be charged with corruption after he was asked to make a submission as to why the former president should not be recharged. “The time has arrived for the NPA to reinstate the 783 counts of corruption, fraud, racketeering and money-laundering against Zuma. The DA will accept nothing less,” Breytenbach said. She said, for Zuma to face the charges would be a victory for both the DA and South Africa. “As a result of our dogged, unwavering pursuit of justice we will all know, today or in the days to come, whether or not Zuma will finally have his day in court.” Breytenbach said Zuma cannot be allowed to walk scot-free if he is found guilty of any of the charges brought against him and it is now time to put an end to Abrahams’ antics of delaying. -TNA Reporter
