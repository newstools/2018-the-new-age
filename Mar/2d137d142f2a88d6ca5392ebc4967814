The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) on Thursday called on all workers to embark on a general strike to defend their right to strike. This after the union learnt of government’s intention to implement a raft of new changes to labour laws from 1 May. “One of the changes is, the state intends to impose secret ballots as a condition before we can go on strike. The balloting process is complicated, costly and cumbersome. If implemented, it will make it impossible for workers to go on strike,” Numsa said in a statement. Numsa is part of a coalition of 21 pro-working class movements who have rejected the proposed changes to the labour law. On Human Rights Day, around 5 000 workers took to the streets to hand over a memorandum of demands to the Department of Labour. Numsa President Andrew Chirwa said, among other things, the union was fighting against was the implementation of poverty wages in the form of R3 500. “Our view as Numsa is that we must be talking about a living wage. We went to the Department of Labour and submitted a memorandum of demands. To us, this is the beginning of a struggle which we are going to wage until the government listens,” Chirwa said. According to Numsa, these laws will be applied to all workers in South Africa without consulting the majority of workers. “The state only consulted the leadership of Fedusa, Nactu and COSATU – who form part of Nedlac. The leadership of these unions sold out their members and workers and their families for political expediency,” Numsa said. -TNA Reporter
