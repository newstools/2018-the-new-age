Rustenburg High Court Judge Ronnie Hendricks and murder accused farmers Pieter Doorewaard and Philip Schutte on Monday visited the site where 16-year-old Matlhomola Moshoeu died in Coligny in the North West. Present during the inspection to the site on Monday was the eyewitness who has testified in court that he saw the two farmers push the teenager out of a moving vehicle. The eyewitness also showed the authorities an area where he said the farmers took him and intimidated him after they realised he had witnessed the incident. Accompanying court officials and the police were members of the public, and a group of individuals wearing EFF shirts. The two are accused of killing Moshoeu in Coligny last year. On Monday, the accused showed the judge the spot at the crime scene on the road where Moshoeu died. During their previous appearance, last week, both accused pleaded not guilty in the North West High Court in Mahikeng on charges of murder, intimidation, kidnapping, unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, theft and pointing of a firearm. They are alleged to have apprehended the teenager on the accusation that he stole a sunflower from their farm. Meanwhile the farmers said they had placed Moshoeu at the back of their bakkie with the intention to report him to the police. The teenager allegedly then jumped out of the moving car, leading to injuries to his neck. -TNA Reporter
