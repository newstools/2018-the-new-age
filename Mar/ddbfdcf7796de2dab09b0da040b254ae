Four men, including a Swazi sangoma, are expected to appear in the Witbank Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday for a formal bail application. Thokozani Msibi, 32, Thulani Thobela, 26, Donie Cavin Boshielo, 22 and Mthobisi Brilliant Mkhize, 26, are facing charges of murder and two counts of kidnapping. The police have beefed up security ahead of their court appearance. Last week, during Msibi’s appearance in court, angry residents demanded that the police hand him over to them. SAPS members were forced to fire rubber bullets to disperse community members after residents hurled stones and bottles, damaging the court. The men reportedly broke into the children’s home in Hlalanikahle on 20 January and kidnapped them. Thirteen-year-old Gabisile Shabani’s body was found buried in a shallow grave in Cullinan. Her head and some of her body parts were missing. Meanwhile, the body of 15-month-old Nkosikhona Ngwenya was found near the N4 Highway outside Emalahleni after he was “mistakenly” kidnapped from his home by armed robbers who allegedly wanted his albino cousin of the same age. -TNA Reporter
