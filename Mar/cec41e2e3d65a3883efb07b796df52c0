Netwerk 24 Multimedia Journalist Adrian de Kock says he intends to lay charges against EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu despite him apologising for the assault. De Kock was on Tuesday assaulted by Shivambu and two other people outside parliament. He said he and other journalists were waiting outside the venue where City of Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille’s disciplinary hearing was taking place. Shivambu apologised for the assault in a statement issued through his party. “I accept that my impatience with the gentleman was inappropriate, I regret the incident and believe it should have been handled differently,” Shivambu said. Parliament has condemned the attack on journalists and called on national assembly speaker Baleka Mbete to institute an investigation. ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu called on the Speaker of Parliament to thoroughly investigate the incident. “It is very regrettable and completely unacceptable that a member of Parliament who also happens to be a Chief Whip of a party can be found to be involved in such unbecoming behaviour. “As parliamentarians, we must at all times be the custodians of our Constitution and our democracy, especially media freedom and freedom of expression.” Mthembu added that any journalist working on the parliamentary precinct must be allowed to do their job without any fear of victimisation or hindrance to their work. DA’s Chief Whip Mike Waters also promised that he will be reporting Shivambu to Parliament’s Ethics Committee for to investigate the incident and decide on what appropriate action to be taken. DA Spokesperson Phumzile van Damme said Shivambu’s disgraceful behaviour was indicative of what has become the EFF’s aggressive attitude towards the media. “Just last week, EFF Leader, Julius Malema, accused eNCA of being a platform which “perpetuate white supremacy”. The attacks on eNCA have allegedly, according to the broadcaster, included threatening messages to its journalists.” -TNA Reporter
