Deputy President David Mabuza says the State Owned Enterprises (SOE’s) are central to advancing national objectives through economic and social infrastructure. He said government need to treat Enterprises like public goods that are central in driving the economy. “We are putting in place mechanisms to detect and prevent all forms of corruption and SOEs. SOEs have been at the cutting edge in providing life-changing infrastructure for our people.” Mabuza was responding to questions posed by members of the National Council of Provinces in Cape Town. He told NCOP members that corruption was like cancer, saying that if it was not dealt with in the time it will grow and kill the SOE’s. Mabuza further said government failures have led to deteriorating SOE finances and crippling bailouts. He, however, told NCOP that the inter-ministerial committee on SOEs has capacitated the board of SAA and also fast-tracked the appointment of the new CEO to oversee the implementation of the new turnaround strategy. Mabuza also said the government will focus on the implementation and recommendation made by the presidential review commission on SOE. “We have completed a government shareholder policy to enable the drafting an effective legislation.Cabinet has further developed a national guide for the appointment of board members at SOEs which will also regulate the appointment of CEOs.” -Sipho Jack
