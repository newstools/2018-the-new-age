THE newly-appointed Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, has moved to allay fears around land expropriation without compensation, reiterating President Cyril Ramaphosa’s assurance that it will be carried out in a manner that “ensures food security, increases agricultural production and improves economic growth”. Parliament recently passed a motion to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation, which has been a hotly-debated topic across the country after the ANC adopted the land expropriation without compensation policy at its Nasrec conference. A land audit report released by the department earlier this year said black South Africans own only 4% of the land in the country. The department says this is a direct result of historical injustices and as a result the land issue cannot be left unresolved. In a statement, the department has urged the public, investors and the international community to “exercise patience and trust the capabilities of Parliament to handle this matter appropriately in the interest of all South Africans and all who live in South Africa”. The department has also assured that it will strive to accelerate land reform within the current policies and legislation while waiting for parliamentary processes to be finalised. This comes two days after civil rights organisation AfriForum launched an international petition on what it says is a threat to property rights in the country. AfriForum says the petition is aimed at warning foreign investors that their investments are not safe in South Africa if land expropriation without compensation becomes law. The petition is in reaction to the recent motion passed by Parliament, which allows for the expropriation of land without compensation. The treasury has allocated the department R10.8bn to accelerate settlement of 2 581 restitution claims and R4.2bn to acquire 291000ha of land. leratod@thenewage.co.za -LERATO DIALE
