The Democratic Alliance (DA) will on Sunday announce the names of the members who have been nominated to contest for the Party’s Federal Leadership. Earlier this month the party opened the nomination process ahead of Federal Congress, which is set to take place on 06 and 07 April 2018 at the Tshwane Events Centre. “In terms of the clause 6.1.4 of the Federal Constitution, the Federal Congress elects the Leader, Federal Chairperson and three Deputy Federal Chairpersons,” the DA said in a statement. Following the election of the Federal Leadership and conclusion of the Federal Congress, the party said 155 members of the Federal Council will convene its first meeting in order to elect the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of Federal Council as well as the Federal Chairperson of Finance. -TNA Reporter
