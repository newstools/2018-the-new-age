The Bellville Regional Court in Cape Town has sentenced alleged gangster John Arnoldus to 35 years imprisonment on two counts of murder and one of attempted murder. SAPS Captain FC Van Wyk said, in January 2016, a Somalian national had been shot dead at his shop, by an unknown male and the case related to that incident was investigated by the police. “In a separate incident, again in January 2016, shots were fired in William Taylor and Nick Kearns streets, Bellville South. One male was fatally wounded and another was taken to the hospital,” Van Wyk said. Arnoldus, who was arrested in November 2016, was also linked to the shooting by a ballistic report, as he used the same firearm. In February 2017, Arnoldus was released on bail and after being released, committed another crime. This led to his arrested in November. Western Cape police commissioner Lieutenant-General KE Jula has commended the investigating officer, Detective Constable Faizel Hercules, for the sterling work. “He particularly cites his efforts in ensuring witnesses remained safe and were placed in witness protection. The community of Bellville South is also applauded for working with the police in these cases,” Jula said. -TNA Reporter
