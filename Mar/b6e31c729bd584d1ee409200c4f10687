City of Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga has officially announced his availability to serve as the DA’s Federal Chairperson. Msimanga, who was nominated by the party’s three provincial leaders, is expected to go head to head with Athol Trollip who has been in the position for a number of years. The DA will on Sunday announce the names of members who have been nominated to contest for the party’s federal leadership after the process was closed on Friday last week. The congress is scheduled to take place from 7 to 8 April at the Tshwane Events Centre, where the party’s new leadership will be elected. The executive mayor said the experience of having been the party’s chairperson for the North Gauteng region, Gauteng province and currently as mayor of Tshwane gives him the confidence that he will be the best candidate to help lead the party into 2019 elections. “The experience I have gained of being the executive mayor for the capital city has offered me the opportunity to put good governance into practice by cutting a bloated city structure and putting first the needs of the millions of South Africans living in Tshwane,” Msimanga said. Msimanga said, by being the federal chairperson, he would make sure he assisted the leadership of the party in bringing transformative governance to the new and old throughout the country and unite South Africans behind one vision and one mission. -TNA Reporter
