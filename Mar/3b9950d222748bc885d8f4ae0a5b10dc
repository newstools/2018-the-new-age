FRIENDS and family of Durban triathlete Mhlengi Gwala who is still recovering from his leg operation after being attacked with a hacksaw in the early hours of Tuesday morning believe jealousy may have been the motive behind the attack. His friend, Sandile Shange, said the fact that his attackers tried to hack off both of Gwala’s legs reeked of sabotage. “What robber when given an iPhone and a Garmin watch worth thousands would not take it but instead want to saw your legs off,” he said. Gwala was attacked near the University of KZN’s Rick Turner (Francois) Road, Howard Campus, at about 3am on Tuesday. He was cycling from his home in Chesterville to meet up with Shange before riding off to training together. “We are both fussy about time and stick to the same route every time. When he didn’t turn I thought he was running late and he would catch up with me along the way. When I received the phone call asking me to help, I thought he had a puncture or something then he said he was at the hospital and had been attacked I was shocked and froze because I thought he had overslept and he was playing games,” Shange said. It is alleged that the men dragged Gwala into a secluded bush near UKZN, where they held him down and tried to saw off his leg. The father of two offered his phone and watch which the robbers allegedly ignored. “We’re in a small and competitive sectors, there’s always murmurs but we never think anything of it. Everyone knew Mhlengi was doing big things and is recognised. There’s bound to be jealousy but to take to this level of making sure that he never competes its too much. “His (Mhlengi), girlfriend and kids have been left traumatised by this whole incident. He is trying to be positive for them but he is in pain and holding to the success of the operation,” Shange said. sibongisenim@thenewage.co.za
