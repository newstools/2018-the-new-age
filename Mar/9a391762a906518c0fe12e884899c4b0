Several company CEOs have presented President Cyril Ramaphosa with proposals on initiatives that may aid economic recovery in South Africa, from many sectors and create jobs. The CEOs held a meeting with Ramaphosa on Tuesday where business leaders and government shared ideas on how to grow the economy. The sectors identified as having potential to create more jobs include advanced manufacturing, meaningful jobs in the agricultural sector, monetising digital capabilities to boost the economy and the development of logistics systems in order to enable and accelerate economic growth in order for the country to be able to fight one of the highest unemployment rates in the world. During his inaugural State of the Nation Address (Sona), Ramaphosa promised that government would intervene decisively in order to stabilise and revitalise state-owned companies and would also take further measures to ensure that all state-owned companies fulfilled their economic and developmental mandates, as important catalysts through which government creates public value. “They have further committed to key actions to leverage the power and scale state-owned companies as a cohesive and effective group contributing to economic growth through improved governance, economic recovery, state-own company reform and transformation, which includes procurement practices, develop finance and support for women in skills and business development,” Ramaphosa’s spokesperson Khusela Diko said. Diko said Ramaphosa had welcomed the commitment of CEOs to reposition state-owned companies as enablers of growth, driven by a common vision and higher levels of cooperation and synergy and said there will be another meeting in the near future. -TNA Reporter
