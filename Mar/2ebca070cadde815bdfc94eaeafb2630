The Department of Women (DoW) has reacted with shock to topbet’s conduct after a female staff was strip-searched. The manager had ordered a cleaner to check which of the women at the Germiston branch was on her period. The strip-searched was done after  blood stains were found in the toilets. “Therefore the department is aghast to learn that Gladys Radebe, 56, who opened a case of sexual harassment against the Topbet branch manager who ordered the search, had been suspended. This is secondary victimisation of Radebe. “Notwithstanding that the branch manager was suspended and subsequently fired, DoW trusts that the female advocate appointed to investigate the matter will ensure that the matter is thoroughly ventilated, and that the outcome of this internal legal process will result in real and meaningful justice for the victims. “DoW would like to commend Radebe for her courageous stance against the violation of her rights by opening a case of sexual harassment against Topbet,” said DoW in a statement. -TNA Reporter
