Musician and former ANC MP Jennifer Ferguson has laid criminal charges against South African Football Association (Safa) president Danny Jordaan. After almost five months having made the accusations against Jordaan that he sexually assaulted her about 24 years ago. The singer confirmed that she had laid the rape charges against him. “After many months of deep consideration, consultation and attempts to mediate according to principles of restorative justice as embodied by the Truth and Reconciliation process South Africa has followed, I have decided to lay a charge of rape against Danny Jordaan. I do this in the hope that other victims of sexual abuse will be empowered to speak out and act. I do this and ask for your support prayerful, in thought or action for all those affected by his sexual misconduct,” she said. The singer first made the accusations last year motivated by the #MeToo campaign that encouraged women to speak out against their sexual assault experiences. However, she had not laid charges against the SAFA boss then. “I also am aware of the distress his family must be experiencing and express my sadness that they are inevitably affected,” she said. In the wake of the accusations against him, Jordaan had initially kept quiet. However, following public outcry for his comment in the issue he had then issued a statement and denied the claims. Gauteng Police spokesperson Lungelo Dlamini confirmed that the rape case has been opened in Johannesburg in the Parkview police station. Dlamini said that the case has since been transferred to Port Elizabeth. -TNA Reporter
