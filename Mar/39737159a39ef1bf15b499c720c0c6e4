THE Gauteng department of health says the no work, no pay rule will apply to forensic pathologists who embarked on an illegal strike at a Germiston Mortuary last week. “The principle of no work, no pay will be implemented to all employees who embarked on unprotected industrial action across the board,” the department said. The South African Liberated Public Sector Workers Union (Salipswu) has denied that its workers were on strike saying they had embarked on suspension of dissection and other procedures demanding that they be formally trained and formal qualifications be issued to them upon completion of the training. This has led to disruption of services at the Germiston Mortuary with various families being forced to wait for postmortems on their loved ones. On Thursday last week the department applied for an interdict against the striking workers. The interdict was granted on Friday. “As presented in court, the department has addressed all other concerns the officers have raised, including those from national bargaining. “The Health Professions Council has finalised requirements (for training) and these will be gazetted nationally,” the department said. It has reminded striking pathologists that they are rendering essential services as per Section 71 (8) of the Labour Relations Act. -LERATO DIALE
