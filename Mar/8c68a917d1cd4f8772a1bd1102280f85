Two Jozi@Work employees have been arrested for attempting to solicit a bribe of R6000 from their former supervisor. It is said that the bribe was to stop continued violent protests in the city of Johannesburg and damage to infrastructure around Berea and Joubert Park as they were behind the Jozi@Work protests. Protests have been taking place over the past few weeks. “It is clear that these two suspects were determined to prevent the city from providing needed refuse removal services to communities, particularly those in the inner city,” Johannesburg Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba said. The two are expected to appear in the Hillbrow Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday and will be charged with malicious damage to property and intimidation. “I would like to thank all the law enforcement agencies, including SAPS and JMPD, who were involved in the operation. For Johannesburg to be a city of opportunity for all, the rule of law must be upheld. The days of criminals operating with impunity have to come to an end.” -TNA Reporter
