A new video has surfaced of Australia’s David Warner swearing at Quinton de Kock at Kingsmead on Sunday. The incident happened on the fourth day of the Durban Test which Warner is seen and heard calling De Kock a “f***ing sook” during a tirade that directly preceded their tunnel fracas in the first Test. In the second video which was captured on CCTV shows Warner confronting De Kock in the Kingsmead tunnel at the end of the second session. The duo have since been charged by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for ‘bringing the game into disrepute.’ The umpires officiating in the Durban Test have reported Warner for a level 2 offence and de Kock for a level 1 offence for “conduct that brings the game into disrepute” following the incident in the stairwell near their dressing rooms. -TNA Reporter
