The Commission for Gender Equality (CGE) on Wednesday said it had noted with concern media reports alleging sexual harassment and human rights violation at gambling company Topbet SA in Germiston. Earlier this week, media reports emerged claiming 20 female staff members were strip-searched by cleaners, after being instructed by the manager, in order to identify a person who allegedly left menstrual blood in the communal toilets. The manager has since been fired by the company. Commission spokesperson Javu Baloyi said the commission was empowered by the Constitution to investigate any gender-related issues of its own accord, or on receiving a complaint. “…and shall endeavour to resolve any dispute or rectify any act or omission by mediation, conciliation or negotiation,” Baloyi said. Baloyi thanked the media for bringing the issue to the public domain and urged any worker, especially female workers affected by the sexual harassment and human rights violation, to phone the commission’s toll-free number 0800 007 709 or alternatively the head office on 011 403 7182. -TNA Reporter
