The Department of Labour Chief Inspector has announced the appointment of Phumudzo Maphaha as the Presiding Inspector over the Grayston Drive Pedestrian and cyclist structural bridge collapse inquiry. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Tibor Szana said Maphaha will take over from Lennie Samuel who has been presiding since the inquiry was set up. Maphaha previously presided over the Tongaat Mall Structural Collapse inquiry and the Meyersdal Structural Collapse. Szana said Samuel has fallen ill and is no longer in a position to continue presiding over the inquiry. “I have subsequently appointed Mr P.O Maphaha as the presiding inspector to take over from Mr Samuel due to the gravity of his illness.” The Grayston Drive Pedestrian and cyclist structural bridge collapse inquiry was announced by the Department of Labour in 2015. The Department of Labour set up section 32 hearing to investigate negligence that may have resulted in occupational injuries and the death of people. The incident led to the death of two people and 19 were injured. The inquiry last held its sitting on 27 September 2017 and was postponed to July 2018. -TNA Reporter
