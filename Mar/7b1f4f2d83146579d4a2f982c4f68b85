A Limpopo pupil has approached the High Court seeking to reverse his school’s decision to expel him, for having long hair. Grade 10 learner Kamogelo Kekana was expelled from Hoërskool Piet Potgieter in Mokopane last week after allegedly going to school with hair longer than four centimetres. According to Kekana’s lawyer advocate Mphafolane Koma, the school’s policy is that only white pupils are allowed to have long hair at the school. “This learner was expelled from school on Thursday last week because he had long hair. Blacks are only allowed to have one centimetre-long hair,” Koma said. School principal Jimmy Steele said the learner was expelled for violating the school’s policy on hair but has since been allowed to return to school. “I can confirm to you that the student is back in class. He is busy with a catch-up programme after missing s few classes,” Steele said. Steele said he would convene a school governing body meeting to decide on how to respond to the notice to appear in court on Thursday as they only received it late on Tuesday. He refused to answer questions on what the school policy on pupils’ hair. “I can’t say that because as you know ,we have been asked to appear in court. We will take all that information to court.” Attempts to get comment from Limpopo education department spokesperson Sam Makondo about the case were unsuccessful. Makondo said he was in a meeting before hanging up. -TNA Reporter
