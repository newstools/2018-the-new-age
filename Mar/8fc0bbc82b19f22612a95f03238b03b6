The South African National Civic Organisation (SANCO) on Thursday condemned the assault of a female train driver who was allegedly hit on the head with a rock, dragged into the bushes and stripped in Pretoria. The incident happened at the Eerste Fabrieke Station on Tuesday evening after the train was vandalised. “There is no justification for this criminality which needs to be uprooted across the public transport system and in our communities. The worst could have happened had the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) intervention team not arrived on time to rescue her from her assailants,” SANCO National Spokesperson, Jabu Mahlangu said. A group of commuters is alleged to have attacked the female driver, bringing the number of drivers who have been attacked in the recent weeks to ten. According to Prasa’s Head of Marketing and Communications Nana Zenani, the incident occurred as a result of train stoppages due to an emergency fail-safe system that is on new trains. Zenani said the cause of the fail-safe system is that it is vandalized, and as result causing the constant stoppages. “We were running behind schedule because the new trains were running but they kept being vandalised and being interrupted. Unfortunately, as a result of that, it escalated to such a point where one of our drivers was attacked in such a grievous way.” Following the incident, train services in the area have been suspended for the fear of employees. Mahlangu said that the indefinite suspension of train services in the area is an inconvenience to commuters. “Without condoning the abhorrent behaviour of the criminals that must be tracked down and severely punished, Prasa must take responsibility for triggering the unruly behaviour that puts the lives of its employees at risk and resolve the matter as speedily as possible.” He further called on Prasa to beef up security to protect workers and commuters against such ‘hooliganism’. -TNA Reporter
