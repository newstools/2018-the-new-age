Chief Director of Expenditure Planning at National Treasury Dr Kay Brown will be released from her duties in the department at the end of March. This follows Brown’s appointment as the Chief Executive Officer of the Financial and Fiscal Commission, effective from April 1. Brown joined the Treasury in 2002 as a policy analyst, working on the criminal justice system. In 2007 she headed up the expenditure planning unit, managing the budget process. She has also been responsible for South Africa’s participation in international budget reform forums and South Africa’s responses to international country assessments. Among others, she has also served as the Chairperson of the Collaborative Africa Budget Reform Initiative and represented the country in international structures such as the Global Initiative for Fiscal Transparency (GIFT). National Treasury Director-General Dondo Mogajane has extended her well wishes to Brown in her new responsibilities. “It is with mixed emotions that we bid farewell to one of our long-serving public servants. Dr Brown has been with the National Treasury for 16 years. Her contribution to the organisation has been immense, her achievements countless.” Mogajane also expressed joy that Brown will still be part of the Finance family even in her new position. “We know that she will tackle this new venture with the same passion and dedication that she displayed as part of our team. We wish her all the best and believe that she will continue to succeed in this new phase of her professional career.” -TNA Reporter
