The South African Broadcasting Corporations (SABC) will launch an investigation on the abrupt removal of Sakina Kamwendo’s from her show the forum. The corporation said the executive management has requested a full scaled report on what transpired on Friday. “The SABC has executive management has noted with concern the incident that occurred on the programme, the forum at 8 on SAFM yesterday 30 march. The executive management has requested for a full report on the incident and will engage all involved to get facts on what really happened and why.” On Friday Kamwendo’s last show was shut down by management, halfway through the allotted hour. It is reported that producers of the show were instructed to take her off air and fill in the time with any available music. According to reports she was embarrassed because she voiced out her dissatisfaction on how the announcement regarding her removal from the show was handled. A source close to her revealed that Kamwendo first heard of her removal from another station, adding that her contract would not be renewed. Meanwhile, while trying to explain its conduct the corporation was at pain in justifying the manner they handled the matter by revealing that Kamwendo’s contract with them was terminated. The management further said she was engaged prior to her going live on air regarding the status of her contract. “It is also important to deal with the perception that Ms Sakina Kamwendo’s contract with the SABC has been terminated. Prio to the programme yesterday, she was engaged by new management on a new slot on SAFM and both parties have signed a new contract to that effect,” the SABC said. -TNA Reporter
