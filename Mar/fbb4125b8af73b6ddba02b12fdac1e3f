ATHOL Trollip, the last white mayor of a metro still standing but in danger of being toppled by the EFF, has been nominated for re-election of a major leadership position in the DA. But he is also being challenged for this job, that of DA federal chairperson, by two others including Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga. As expected, Mmusi Maimane will not be facing a contender and will be re-elected as party leader when the DA hold its federal congress in Tshwane on April 7 and 8. The gathering, the biggest yet to be held by the DA, will elect a party leader, federal chairperson and three deputy federal chairpersons. The 155 members of the federal council will vote for the chairperson and two deputy chairpersons of the federal council, as well as the federal chairperson of finance. The party’s constitutional review committee has also moved a constitutional amendment to elect two deputy chairpersons of the federal council, which will be voted on during the congress. Trollip, mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay who will face an EFF-backed motion of no confidence next month, will be defending his position as DA federal chairperson against Msimanga and DA Free State chairperson and MP Annelie Lotriet. No challenger has emerged to federal executive chairperson James Selfe, who has held that position for the past 15 years. During this time, Selfe has been a major driving force in building the DA, as well being the fulcrum of the party’s many legal challenges against the state. One of these was the cause to review and rescind the National Prosecuting Authority’s decision to drop fraud and corruption charges against former president Jacob Zuma. Announcing the nominations, DA chief electoral officer Anchen Dreyer said the leadership congress would be the largest in the history of the party. -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN|news@thenewage.co.za
