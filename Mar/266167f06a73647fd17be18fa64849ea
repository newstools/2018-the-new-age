The EFF on Saturday accused the ANC of masquerading as an unemployment forum to disrupt voter registration in Marikana. According to the red berets, the disruption led to the closure of two voting stations in the area. “It is not a secret that the ANC finds it hard to win popular support in this town. They have now resorted to violence and hooliganism, masquerading as marchers in demand of employment,” the EFF said in a statement. Political parties at the weekend went on a drive to recruit supporters to register to vote in the upcoming national elections. EFF leader Julius Malema on Saturday led the voter registration campaign in his hometown Seshego in Polokwane. The EFF has further accused the police of doing nothing to contain the situation. “We condemn the police, who stood by and did nothing as hooligans intimidated ordinary citizens and disrupted voting stations to a point of shutdown.” The EFF has called on the IEC to choose a new date and reopen the voting stations that were disrupted, to afford the people who failed to register an opportunity to register. -TNA Reporter
