Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga is expected to brief the media on Thursday on an infrastructure Council of Education Ministers (CEM) meeting. This follows the minister’s request to all provincial education MECs, heads of departments and officials responsible for infrastructure to attend an urgent CEM meeting. The meeting was intended to enable the minister to ensure that the sector responds to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s directives of providing him with an audit of sanitation facilities in schools within three months and thereafter a comprehensive plan to address shortcomings identified in the audit. Last week, Ramaphosa directed the minister to conduct an audit of all learning facilities with unsafe structures, especially unsafe ablution facilities, within a month. Motshekga will present the audit to Ramaphosa with a plan to rectify the challenges, as an emergency interim measure while rolling out proper infrastructure. Ramaphosa’s instruction followed the death of five-year-old Viwe Jali who fell into a pit toilet at the Luna Primary School in Bizana, Eastern Cape last Tuesday. “The plan to eliminate unsafe ablution facilities will be participatory, with civil society being consulted. To this end, he further welcomes input by civil society organisations who continue to champion the struggle for safe and decent school infrastructure,” Ramaphosa’s spokesperson Khusela Diko said. In a recent report by the National Education Infrastructure Management System, it revealed that the Eastern Cape has just under 2 000 schools with plain pit toilets and more than 2 500 with ventilated pit latrines. Meanwhile, pressure group Equal Education is seeking to compel Motshekga to implement minimum norms and standards on infrastructure in schools. -TNA Reporter
