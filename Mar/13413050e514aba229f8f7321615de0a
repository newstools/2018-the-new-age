DA leader Mmusi Maimane will on Tuesday address residents of Nelson Mandela Bay in the Eastern Cape about the metro’s successes under Mayor Athol Trollip, ahead of the EFF’s motion of no confidence. Trollip faces a motion of no confidence in his leadership after EFF leader Julius Malema announced that, as a warning shot to the DA for not supporting its land expropriation without compensation motion, the party would table the motion. Council speaker Jonathan Lawack and council Chief Whip Werner Senekal also face motions of no confidence. Maimane, who will be speaking at Babs Madlakane Hall at the KwaNobuhle location during a ‘Save Nelson Mandela Bay Campaign’, has accused the EFF of trying to hand over the governing of the metro to the corrupt ANC – and that won’t be good for residents. “The EFF wants to give the municipality back to the corrupt ANC, which will ultimately harm the people of Nelson Mandela Bay,” Maimane said. Maimane will be joined by DA Eastern Cape provincial leader Nqaba Bhanga, Chairperson Andrew Whitfield and Trollip. About 120 councillors in the metro have signed a petition calling for the motion to be brought forward to 29 March, after it was initially scheduled for 6 April. -TNA Reporter
