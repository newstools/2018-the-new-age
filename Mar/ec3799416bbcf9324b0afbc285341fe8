THE DA has slammed moves to pay financial rewards to three Steinhoff board members and has insisted Parliament demands an explanation from the company. In a statement DA MP Alf Lees questioned Steinhoff’s plans to reward Heather Sonn, Johan van Zyl and Steve Booysen. Lees said that the decision should be interrogated when Steinhoff appears before Parliament’s standing committee on finance tomorrow. It has been reported that Steinhoff wants to pay audit and risk committee head Booysen and acting chairperson Sonn €200000 (R2.9m) each and Van Zyl €100000. “It is simply reckless that the same individuals who were running the company when financial reports were apparently manipulated are now being ‘rewarded’ for fixing the mess they created,” Lees said in a statement. The Steinhoff board was under a moral obligation to minimise financial losses to investors, not least of which were the pensioners and Government Employees Pension Fund members, he said. The DA will write to the Public Investment Corporation, as a Steinhoff shareholder, to request that it not only holds the Steinhoff board and executives to account but to refuse the “obscene” financial rewards that have apparently been proposed. “Steinhoff executives have failed to show real remorse for the financial damage that the accounting scandal has inflicted on the pensions of ordinary government employees. “No one personifies this defiance better than former Steinhoff CEO Markus Jooste who will most likely ignore the invitation to appear before the standing committee on finance and other parliamentary committees.” Should Jooste fail to appear before the committee tomorrow the DA will request that the oversight committee summons him to appear before it. “There are literally millions of South Africans who have been affected by the collapse of Steinhoff and all the relevant persons must be held to account,” Lees said -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN|news@thenewage.co.za
