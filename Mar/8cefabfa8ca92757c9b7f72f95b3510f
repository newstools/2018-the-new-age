The DA on Thursday said it would lay charges of money laundering and corruption against the Bank of Baroda. This followed a report released by the Organised Crime and Corruption Project (OCCP), containing allegations that the Indian state-owned bank had been laundering money on behalf of the Gupta family. DA shadow minister of public enterprises and member of Parliament Natasha Mazzone said, if the allegations are true, it is a clear violation of the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) Act, which means there are grounds for criminal charges or fines. “We believe that these allegations should be thoroughly investigated and we will now proceed to lay charges against the bank in terms of Sections 29 and 52 of the FIC Act,” Mazzone said. Mazzone said, despite South African banks freezing the Guptas’ accounts and the mounting evidence of state capture, the Bank of Baroda continued to do business with the family and their companies. COOP reportedly found that: Mazzone said the DA would continue to fight against those who directly and indirectly facilitated state capture in the public and private sector. “… and we will ensure that they are held accountable for any wrongdoing.” -TNA Reporter
