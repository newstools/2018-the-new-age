Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela has cautioned Police Minister Bheki Cele over his remarks at the weekend the police must “forget human rights for criminals”. The minister was speaking on Sunday during the funeral of Captain Dumisani Mhlanzi, who was killed during a robbery incident in KwaZulu-Natal last week. Speaking in IsiZulu, Cele said: “Human Rights are for human beings, they are not for animals. Because when you take a gun and plan to go shoot a police officer who is going about doing his business, you are not a human being.” “We fully support Minister Bheki Cele in combating crime but human rights of suspects or accused persons are still human rights and their violation is a violation of the Constitution,” Madonsela said. Cele said that he agreed with the Human Rights Commission, however those that behave like beasts should be treated as beats and only those that behave as humans shall be treated as such. During his previous tenure as national police commissioner, Cele is alleged to have instructed the police to use heavy force in dealing with criminals. He was also then alleged to have uttered the “shoot to kill” statement. Meanwhile, following public outcry on developments of slain Bafana Bafana and Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa’s murder case, Cele said that he had since met with National Police Commissioner General Khehla Sithole to discuss the matter. He said that the recent developments in the matter on Twitter was a “big call” that Meyiwa’s case be resolved. “We are duty bound that one day people have to know what happened to Senzo and why it happened and somebody will have to account,” Cele said. -TNA Reporter
