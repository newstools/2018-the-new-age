THE management of OR Tambo International has advised passengers travelling to the airport by road of possible disruptions by protesting taxi drivers. Spokesperson Leigh Gunkel-Keuler said the airport had received unconfirmed reports of plans for protest action that would start early today. Gunkel-Keuler said the protest could involve attempts to obstruct the R21 and R24 highways – as well as rail links – with the objective of disrupting access to the airport. “We would advise passengers to anticipate delays and leave earlier for the airport,” Gunkel-Keuler says. The possible blockading of the R21 and R24 highways would precede other protest action by taxi associations which have received the necessary approval from local authorities. The aim of the protest action is to highlight grievances of the Ekurhuleni Taxi Industry under the Ekurhuleni leadership of both the South African National Taxi Council and the National Taxi Alliance, against the Ekurhuleni metropolitan municipality. dikeledir@thenewage.co.za -DIKELEDI MOLOBELA
