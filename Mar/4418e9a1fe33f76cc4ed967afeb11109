Parliament’s portfolio committee on higher education and training on Wednesday called on all institutions of higher learning to introduce stringent policies on sexual conduct. The call comes after reports that a University of South Africa (Unisa) employee violated a female colleague and asked for sexual favours. “This condemnable behaviour of forced sexual favours is unacceptable. Institutions need to start developing a tough policy that will not only deal with sexual offences but also serve as a deterrent,” Chairperson of the committee Connie September said. September called on Unisa to provide counselling services expeditiously to the victim of sexual misconduct at the institution. Meanwhile, the committee has applauded the tough sentence given to a former Walter Sisulu University student accused of rape. “Institutions are places of learning, teaching and skills enhancement, not places of fear.” Septemeber indicated that the committee would write to tertiary institutions to ascertain their policies regulating sexual conduct. -TNA Reporter
