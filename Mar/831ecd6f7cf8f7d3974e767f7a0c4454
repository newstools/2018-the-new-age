A second suspect in the albinism case is expected to apply for bail in the Witbank Magistrate’s Court. It follows the killing of 13-year-old Gabisile Shabani, who was living with albinism and her one-year-old cousin Nkosikhona Ngwenya who was “mistakenly” kidnapped from his home by armed robbers – who allegedly wanted his albino cousin of the same age. Shabani’s body was found buried in a shallow grave in Cullinan. Her head and some of her body parts were missing and it is reported that they were taken to Swaziland. Meanwhile, Ngwenya’s body was found near the N4 Highway outside Emalahleni. Thokozani Msibi, 32, from Swaziland, who is reportedly one of three men accused of the kidnapping the two children, appeared in the Witbank Magistrate’s Court for a formal bail application last week. The magistrate indicated that the case was very serious and the manner that the children were killed was brutal. The bail application was then denied. Earlier this month, three more suspects were arrested in connection with the killing. The trio, Thulani Thobela, 26, Donie Cavin Boshielo, 22 and Mthobisi Brilliant Mkhize, 26, were arrested in Vosman on Wednesday after a manhunt by the police. -TNA Reporter
