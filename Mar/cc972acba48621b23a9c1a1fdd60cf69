A 41-year-old suspect is expected to appear at the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court on Friday following his arrest by the Hawks’ South African Narcotics Enforcement Bureau (SANEB) for possession of drugs. Hawks spokesperson Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu said that the team was on an unrelated investigation when they observed a suspect getting out of a parked vehicle hastily, got into a different vehicle and drove off. “This raised suspicion and the team immediately pursued the vehicle and intercepted it shortly afterwards.” He said a search resulted in a recovery of drugs worth approximately R5.2 million inside boxes. “The suspect was then arrested immediately and both vehicles were impounded for further investigation.” -TNA Reporter
