Saselamani police outside Malamulele in Limpopo on Tuesday launched a massive manhunt following the killing of three people on Monday. According to Limpopo police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe, a man and woman, both in their 30s, were kidnapped while driving a Toyota Tazz near the Makonde village outside Thohoyandou. Ngoepe said they were then loaded into the boot and drove to a secluded area near the Matiyani village along the Punda Maria road, where they were killed. “They were fatally shot, set alight inside the vehicle and burnt beyond recognition,” Ngoepe said. He said a third person’s body was also found with multiple gunshot wounds a few metres from the burnt out vehicle. “The motive behind this incident is still unknown but police investigations will reveal once the arrests have been made.” He said the police were busy with identifying the victims before their names could be known to the public. -TNA Reporter
