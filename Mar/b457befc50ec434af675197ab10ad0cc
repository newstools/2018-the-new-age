The EFF has condemned a decision to place VBS under curatorship. South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) Governor Lesetja Kganyago on Sunday announced that VBS Mutual Bank would be placed under curatorship. The announcement came after National Treasury instructed municipalities to stop investing with the bank. Municipalities withdrew about R1 billion from the cash-struck bank. “The EFF believes that placing a bank under curatorship should always be a last resort, something to be done after exhausting different rescue measures and interventions. Opting for curatorship as the first measure undermines the bank and undermines black people’s participation in the ownership and control of financial services institutions,” the EFF said in a statement. The EFF said Treasury issued an instruction knowing that such an instruction would immediately collapse the bank. “The EFF is aware that VBS is being victimised due to a loan it gave to Mr Jacob Zuma for a house in Nkandla. Had it been a white-owned bank that had offered Zuma a loan, they would not be subject to victimisation today” “The EFF was the first t to question VBS giving Zuma a loan but we were led to believe, even by the Reserve Bank, that it was above board.” Meanwhile, the Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF) has also expressed its disappointment in the decision taken by Treasury. The PPF has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to intervene in the matter. “We call on the ANC President and President of the country Cyril Ramaphosa to intervene urgently to stop the artificially created crisis and ensure that this matter is amicably resolved without delay,” the PPF said in a statement. “It cannot be celebrated that an ANC-led and run government promotes laws that hinder and destroy blacks that do business with government. The ANC must be advocates on transformation in theory and in practice in order to maintain the integrity of its revolutionary messages.” -TNA Reporter
