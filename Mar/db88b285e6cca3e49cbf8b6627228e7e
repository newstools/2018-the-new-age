The South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) Monetary Policy Committee has reduced the repo rate by 0.25%. Sarb Governor Lesetja Kganyago on Wednesday announced that the committee had decided on the cut, which equals 25 basis points, after considering several factors. The repo rate is the rate at which the Sarb lends lend money to commercial banks. The central bank last cut rates in July 2017, highlighting an improving inflation outlook but warning of a slowdown in economic growth. The prime lending rate, which is the interest charged by banks to clients, is now at 10%, which brings the prime lending rate to 10%. This is the rate at which banks charge interest. Consumer inflation, which the bank uses as a guide for deciding rates, has remained within the bank’s target of 3% to 6% for the past year and is expected to average 4.9% this year. Kganyago raised concern over the drought currently ravaging the Western Cape and public servant wages, as they had they had the potential to disrupt economic growth. -TNA Reporter
