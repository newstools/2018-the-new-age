African fusion hip hop artist and producer Superstar Ace has released a self-produced track that offers a great commercial-appeal sound with a fresh twist, fusing hip hop, Afro-beat and pop, allowing the vocals to blend with different sonic elements. The new hit single ‘Wassa Wassa’ means naughty and Superstar Ace is set to take the African music industry to new heights with his latest Afrofuturism (African and Future) look and feel.

There are more interconnections that are rising thanks to social media breaking boundaries across the continent and taking music closer to the people”, Superstar Ace said. The Nigerian-born artist is not new to the music industry. He’s been behind the mic since 2009. His first major performance was as an opening act at the Sound City Urban Music Blast Concert in Lagos opening for the now defunt JOZI hip-hop group in Lagos, Nigeria. Wassa Wassa is a single off Superstar Ace’s upcoming debut project after the underground success of Summer Time featuring Anatii. In 2017 he released a hit single, Summer Time featuring Anatii. .@TransAfrica872 #NP “summertime” by @SuperstarAce ft @ANATII starts off the second hour of #Utopia872 with @KeaNcube #AfricanMusicHQ #1Voice1Africa #DSTV872 #OVHd609 https://t.co/8aUJX16fQF pic.twitter.com/vcQukSIXaG — The Utopia Show (@UtopiaShow872) November 28, 2017 -TNA Reporter
