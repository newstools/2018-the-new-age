The DA has laid a complaint to B-BBEE Commissioner Zodwa Ntuli on possible fake B-BBEE certificates allegedly used by Gupta owned companies to secure contracts from Eskom. The DA’s Shadow Minister of Trade and Industry Dean Macpherson and his deputy Ghaleb Cachalia presented evidence supporting their claims to Ntuli. Ntuli has agreed to investigate certificates used by Tegeta Resources and Exploration, Optimum Coal Mining and Trillian Consulting to get access to contracts with Eskom, the party said in a statement on Monday. It said the investigation would also be expanded to focus on Eskom’s internal procurement procedures, especially as it relates to enforcing B-BBBEE compliance with external suppliers. “The B-BBEE Commission is empowered, in terms of the B-BBEE Act 46 of 2013 to investigate complaints received on any matter concerning broad-based black economic empowerment,” the DA said. The Commission committed to provide the DA with regular updates on the progress of the investigation in line with provisions of its complaints procedure as regulated by the act. The DA said it would bring the alleged fake B-BBEE certificates as evidence to the State Capture inquiry, to be headed by Deputy Chief Justice Judge Raymond Zondo. “For far too long, the Guptas have undermined our institutions and the law with impunity. It has become urgent that they are held accountable for their acts of brazenness in capturing the state with the assistance of former President Jacob Zuma.” -TNA Reporter
