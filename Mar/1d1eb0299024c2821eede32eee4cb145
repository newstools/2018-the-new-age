We need to cooperate with law enforcement officers all the time. Let us be safe on the roads this Easter period,” Nzimande said. The Easter Road Safety Campaign launch is in partnership with the Department of Health, municipalities and taxi associations among others. Driver wellness and fitness is one of the key underlying factors that contribute to accidents in the country. The launch included the activation of halfway stations, a key intervention intended to assist tired drivers to rest after driving long distances.
