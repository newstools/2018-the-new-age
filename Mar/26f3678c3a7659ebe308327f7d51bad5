International Relations and Cooperation Minister Lindiwe Sisulu on Tuesday said through the “good relations” South Africa has with India, it can request that the Guptas to be sent to South Africa, if there are charges against them. “We do have very good relations with India and it would be possible for us to request from the Indian government to allow us to have them sent back, should there be charges against them,” Sisulu said. Sisulu was speaking to Talk Radio 702 on Tuesday following Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba’s briefing on controversial family’s citizenship in the country. Sisulu said the country had an agreement with the government of India which could allow for such an exercise. “We do have a treaty with the government of India and it would be easy for us to be able to ask the Indian government to allow us to have them to come stand trial to answer for anything that we might want to inquire into their affairs in South Africa.” The Gupta brothers are suspected to be hiding in India after being declared fugitives in South Africa. Ajay Gupta was declared a fugitive by the police following his failure to make contact with the Hawks, who issued a warrant for his arrest. This is in connection with pending charges relating to allegations of fraud and corruption over the Estina Farm Community Project in Vrede in the Free State. Sisulu said that their citizenship status did not block the law from acting against them. “And as for the whole process of whether they are citizens or not, it actually does not hold water now. If we have a treaty with India, whether they are Indian citizens or not, they will still have to come and answer for whatever it is that they are charged with.” -TNA Reporter
