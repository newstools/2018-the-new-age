The Department of Agriculture and Land Reforms in KwaZulu-Natal has warned the public about the new spike of rabies. The department said rabies has been detected along the coastal belt of the province affecting South Coast, Durban, ILembe District and King Cetshwayo District. “We have two cases reported of children having both the dog and cat bites in some of these areas. Unfortunately and regrettably, these two cases have resulted in the loss of lives. “The Department has been on a massive vaccination programme since October last year which began in Ndwedwe, Durban and has proceeded to both South and North coast of the province especially in rural areas. Our State Vets are hard at work in this regard,” Department spokesperson Khaya Nkwanyana said. Nkwanyana urged the public not to entertain strange animals especially dogs and cats in their neighborhood, adding that they must report strange dogs and cats to the nearest local offices or to SPCA for collection. Rabies is an acute viral infection that is transmitted to humans or other mammals usually through the saliva from a bite of an infected animal. It is also rarely contracted through breaks in the skin or contact with mucus. -TNA Reporter
