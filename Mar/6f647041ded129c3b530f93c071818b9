BARCLAYS Africa Group, South Africa’s No 2 lender by market value, plans to extend its reach throughout the continent, it said yesterday after posting annual profit up nearly 4%. CEO Maria Ramos said the bank aims to enter Nigeria as it seeks to lift its share of the African market to 12% from 6% over the medium term. Finance director Jason Quinn said: “We would have to think carefully about how and when to enter the Nigerian market and that is what we are going to start doing,” he said. “We have to decide how we enter, whether we acquire or build.” The bank had earlier reported normalised diluted headline earnings per share – the primary measure of profit in South Africa, stripping out once-off items – up 3.9% at 1 837.7 cents for the year to December 31, helped by a 20% drop in credit impairments. Net interest income, a gauge of lending profitability, rose by 1% to R42.32bn, while its net interest margin was unchanged at 4.95%. Barclays Africa said it expects growth in loans and deposits to improve this year and forecasts stronger loan growth from the rest of Africa. It also forecasts stronger loan growth in corporate and investment banking in South Africa. – Reuters
