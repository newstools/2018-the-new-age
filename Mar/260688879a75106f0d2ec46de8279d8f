OUTSMARTED by Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille, the DA has moved to give itself the right to fire party members who refuse to leave elected political offices when ordered to do so. De Lille, who quit as Western Cape leader of the party at the beginning of 2017, survived a no-confidence vote brought against her by her own party by one vote, mainly as a result of the support of opposition parties. She has remained defiant, with her presence as mayor reminding the DA of its impotence. At the weekend, party leader Mmusi Maimane, while briefing the media on the outcomes of its federal executive meeting, gave reasons for the DA’s plans to change its constitution and insert a clause that will allow it to recall or remove its public representatives. Such a clause, Maimane said, while hinting how much the DA had been hurt by its inability to remove De Lille, would provide a mechanism to remove deployees. Maimane also talked about the DA’s forthcoming federal congress, which will be held in Tshwane on April 7 and 8. A new federal leadership, which will lead the DA into the 2019 general election, will be elected at the congress. The seeds of an election manifesto will also be discussed. Maimane reiterated the DA’s position on land redistribution and railed against that of the ANC and EFF, the party that through its partnership has allowed the DA to rule three metros. news@thenewage.co.za -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
