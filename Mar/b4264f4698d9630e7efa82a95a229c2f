President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday said he would look at the points raised a report by the Institute of Race Relations (IRR) which alleges that the budget for VIP protection services grew exponentially during former President Jacob Zuma’s term. The report, authored by the head of politics and governance and former journalist Gareth van Onselen, titled “SA’s Secret Police: Inside the Multi-billion Rand, Clandestine VIP Protection Services”, notes that the unit’s budget grew from R353 million in 2008-2009 to R1.5 billion in 2018-2019 financial year. The money will be spent on the president, deputy president, and dignitaries while they move around the country. Van Onselen also noted that the VIP protective services, which operate under secrecy’s budget, is set to increase to R1.728 billion for the 2020-2021 financial year. He said during his research, he could not get any proper explanation as to why there had been such an astronomical increase in the budget. Ramaphosa’s spokesperson Khusela Diko told News 24 that the president was giving attention to all details raised in the report. Diko said the president is on record as having complained about how government money has been unnecessarily wasted and is also looking at measures this can be curbed. “The president is on record having said he is aware there are inefficiencies and in certain instances wasteful expenditure in government. This is the reason he has initiated reconfiguration of government,” Diko said. The unit came under criticism in a build-up to the ANC elective conference when it granted former ANC presidential contender and current Minister in the Presidency Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma protection even though she was not a member of the Cabinet. -TNA Reporter
