Academic activities at the University of Venda have been halted for a week as students protest over National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) lack of payments. The students took their frustration to the streets since Monday to protest against NSFAS. Former SRC president and Limpopo EFF Students’ Command Chairperson Mandla Shikwambana said that the students will not return to class until their concerns are addressed. “The burning issue is the issue of the food allowance and the book allowance of the students which are not yet loaded.” After realising that payments had not come through, students went to inquire but “never got a proper answer” until they decided to protest. They also want the university to complete a student residence that has been under construction since 2015. Furthermore, the students also want the university to address the lack of academic staff at the institution. Speaking to Capricorn FM Radio, Univen Spokesperson Takalani Dzaga confirmed that the campus had been closed due to the strike. He was however hopeful that classes would resume next week. -TNA Reporter
