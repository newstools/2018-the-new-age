It could take up to two years before the gold medal cyclist, Mhlengi Gwala who has represented the country both nationally and internationally recovers again, said plastic surgeon Dr O Sharran Roy Singh. Speaking during a meeting with newly appointed Minister of Sports, Toko Xasa, Dr Singh said that Gwala’s bone in one leg was transversed by 80% and a major nerve was cut during the attack. Gwala fell victim to a horrific crime while training in the early hours of Tuesday morning were three men attacked him and attempted to cut both his legs off using a chainsaw. “Besides healing physically, Gwala will need to heal psychological as well as the incident has visibly left him traumatised,” said Dr Singh. Gwala who is a sole breadwinner and a well-known athlete in the cycling community has received overwhelming support from the sporting fraternity. Minister Xasa said that they are taking care of bills but people must continue to support. JP Valverde started a campaign to raise R100 000 to pay for the medical bills, as Gwala focuses on recovering. “We are hoping to raise funds to support him with all his medical expenses, transportation, bike replacement and rehabilitation costs,” Valverde said. “We want to see him back on his bike!” -TNA Reporter
