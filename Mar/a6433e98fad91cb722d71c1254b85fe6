The South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) has on Monday launched a digital certificate of evaluation as a pilot to benefit holders of qualifications obtained in other countries. SAQA is the first Qualifications Authority in the world to launch such a digital certificate in a one-year pilot project. “We are proud of this pilot project and the electronic SAQA Certificate of Evaluation,” SAQA CEO, Joe Samuels said. Samuels stated that the digital certificate reduces the lead time it takes to reach the qualification holder. “It can be shared in real-time and can be verified in real-time as evidence to support applications for further studies, visas, employment, registration and/or professional licensing in South Africa.” The digital certificate is offered to holders of valid qualifications that were obtained in other countries upon evaluation of those foreign qualifications. “Going digital in this way puts SAQA at the forefront of the 4th Industrial Revolution which embraces digitisation and its benefits,” he said. “This development builds on the efforts SAQA has made to ensure quicker and more efficient evaluation of foreign qualifications through the establishment of the African Qualifications Verification Network in 2016. “As well as the Southern African Development Community Qualifications Verification Network in 2017, and SAQA’s on-going work with members of the Groningen Declaration Network,” Samuels said. -TNA Reporter
