GAUTENG has surpassed KZN as the province with the highest rate of new HIV infections, latest figures released by the Institute for Race Relations (IRR) on Monday show. The IRR said while major progress had been made in the fight against HIV-Aids, more still needed to be done to ensure progress made is not lost. Figures by the IRR indicate that the total number of new HIV infections have declined from 437 705 to 266 931 between 2009 and 2016. IRR analyst Tawanda Makombo has credited the decline to the improved HIV-Aids awareness and campaigning strategies in schools, hospitals and communities under former president Jacob Zuma, compared to former president Thabo Mbeki’s tenure. An intensified condom distribution campaign in universities across the country has also been credited for the decline in new HIV infections. The IRR warned that while significant progress had been made, an intensified campaign is needed to ensure gains made are not lost. The IRR said according to the latest figures, Gauteng now has the highest number of new infections of all nine provinces. The rate of new infections in Gauteng declined by 27.6% from 102074 in 2009 to 73 951 in 2016. The Northern Cape had the biggest decline in the number of new HIV infections when compared to other provinces, with a 57.6% decline from 5 557 to 2 356 new infections. KZN which had the highest HIV infection at 121 308 in 2009 experienced the highest reduction of almost 50% of its new infections to 62 117 in 2016. KZN has previously been known to have the highest rate of new HIV infections. The province also has the highest number of people living with HIV. “The national Department of Health must intensify HIV-Aids awareness among all South Africans in order to reduce the risk of infection in those at highest risk, especially young people,” Makombo said. Experts agreed, saying while major strides in the fight against HIV have been made, men are falling through the cracks as they are not likely to visit healthcare centres to test leratod@thenewage.co.za -LERATO DIALE
