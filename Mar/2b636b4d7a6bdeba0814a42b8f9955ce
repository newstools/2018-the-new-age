The CRL Rights Commission chairperson Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva says that their investigations of the Ncgobo Seven Angels Ministry church found that it practiced “extremism”. “From what they told us it became clear that what they were preaching was a form of extremism, we thought these were some extremists of one form or another.” Mkhwanazi-Xaluva says that as early as June last year the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL Rights Commission) ran workshops in parliament to explain their report and warned about the suspicious activities that were happening in that church. “We knew even at the point that something horrible would happen there if nothing was done to monitor them of fast-track legislation where their peers could look into that thing and tell us whether it was a church or a cult. “We knew something was happening in Ncgobo and we had no powers to deal with it, we could only rely on the legislation being fast-tracked,” she said. The CRL Rights Commission chairperson said in August they were called back by parliament for an engagement with the religious sector, but the religious organizations asked that they be left to monitor themselves. “We were taken to court by Freedom of Religion for saying: If nothing is done, people are going to die. “I clearly said, if we do nothing people are going to die. In this instance, we prayed that we were wrong but unfortunately, we were 100% right.” Some members of the CRL rights commission are alleged to be receiving threats and are now under protection since taking on a number of religious organizations in the recent past. -TNA Reporter
