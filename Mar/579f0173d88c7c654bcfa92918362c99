Lobby group AfriForum on Monday warned that the “land grab alliance” between EFF leader Julius Malema and President Cyril Ramaphosa could lead to state of anarchy. “Irresponsible statements by Malema and the EFF almost led to anarchistic behavior over the weekend with at least three attempts to occupy land in Gauteng,” AfriForum said in a statement. This comes after a group of alleged EFF supporters invaded land in Olievenhoutbosch near Centurion in Pretoria, on the instruction of their local leadership. AfriForum has also blame the police for poorly handling land grab incidents in Johannesburg. “The SAPS should have acted in Johannesburg in the same manner that they had acted this weekend to remove occupiers from government land. It seems, however, that private land owners are not protected with the same zeal. We have to ask ourselves whether the political will exists to truly protect legal property owners in South Africa,” AfriForum Head of Community Safety Ian Cameron said. According to Cameron, the land grabbing “anarchy and chaos” were as a result of  irresponsible statements by “politicians, including President Cyril Ramaphosa”. Ramaphosa condemned the land grabs on Sunday during his voter registration campaign in Pretoria, saying that this was illegal. However, AfriForum has blamed his leadership for the land grabs after supporting a motion on land expropriation without compensation in Parliament. “The ANC’s adoption of the motion to expropriate land without compensation is one of the driving forces behind these illegal actions.” The EFF tabled the motion to expropriate land without compensation in Parliament last month, which the ANC voted in favour of. -TNA Reporter
