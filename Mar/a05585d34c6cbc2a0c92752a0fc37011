Two drivers are expected to appear in the Kraaifontein Magistrate’s Court on Monday after being found in possession of mandrax tablets worth nearly R3.3 million. The pair were arrested on Saturday in an intelligence-driven operation by the Hawks’ South African Narcotics Enforcement Bureau (SANEB) and Crime Intelligence. Hawks spokesperson Captain Philani Nkwalase said the Hawks-led team spotted the truck off-loading boxes onto a private vehicle in Acacia sStreet, Kraaifontein. “Upon conducting a search, 73 packets, each containing 1000 Mandrax tablets, were found and two suspects, aged 26 and 53, were arrested,” Nkwalase said. It was also found that the drugs were in transit from Gauteng to Cape Town. -TNA Reporter
