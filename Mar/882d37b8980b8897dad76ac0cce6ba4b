Newly appointed Mpumalanga Premier Refilwe Mtshweni has made major appointments to her provincial executive. Mtshweni was elected as premier after the resignation of David Mabuza who took up the Deputy President post. Mtshweni appointed Sibusiso Malaza as MEC of Education, Thandi BT Shongwe as Culture, Sports and Recreation, MEC Norah Mahlangu moved from Culture, Sports and Recreation to Human Settlements and Speedy Mashilo to Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA). Mpumalanga DA leader Jane Sithole thanked Mtshweni for the appointments and also welcomed the removal of Legislature speaker BT Shongwe. Sithole said she hoped that the premier would now deploy a speaker who knows and understands the rules of the house, who respects the country’s constitution and return the decorum of the house by presiding fairly over the proceedings of the Legislature. She said they are however concerned that the premier did not use the opportunity to remove Health MEC Gillion Mashego from the portfolio even though he has dismally under-performed for years. “Critical posts are not filled, infrastructure in the province has dilapidated, He failed to investigate fruitless, wasteful, and irregular expenditures.” Sithole added that under Mashego’s leadership, the department destroyed R5 million worth of medicine in the province and the department also paid suspended officials nearly R8 Million while they were sitting at home doing nothing. “The reasons above were enough to convince Mtshweni to fire Mashego from the health department, but like her predecessor, DD Mabuza, Mtshweni failed to do what is in the best interest of the people of Mpumalanga by removing Mashego as Health MEC. “The DA in the province has visited several health facilities around the province and they are saddened to see the damage caused by Mashego to the millions who depend on the state for health care.” -TNA Reporter
