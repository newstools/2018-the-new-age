Parliament’s portfolio committee on police on Monday said it had raised its concern over the high spate of cash-in-transit robberies with National Police Commissioner General Kehla Sithole. The committee was speaking in reaction to the latest heist, which took place near Ackornhoek and Hoedspruit in Limpopo on Saturday, where security officers were also injured. Committee chairperson Francois Beukman said the committee asked Sithole to give special attention to the cash heists and crime in general as it had now become an evolving trend. Beukman emphasised the committee’s serious concern about organised crime syndicates with automatic weapons that operate frequently in several provinces, targeting cash-in-transit vehicles. “The committee is of the view that Crime Intelligence and detection operations should be increased and the relevant specialised units should be tasked to deal with the current crime trend. “The detection of the crime syndicates should be the major focus of SAPS to ensure that economic activity is not hampered by frequent cash heists,” Beukman said. He said the committee was of the view that there should be close cooperation between SAPS and the relevant private security companies to ensure that risk factors such as internal collusion between staff and syndicates was dealt with head-on. “The cash-in-transit robberies are executed with military-style precision and SAPS needs to adopt strategies to be one step ahead of the syndicates. The use of technology should also be increased as a force multiplier to deal with the current frequency of cash heists.” Beukman said during April’s budget speeches, the committee will be asking the police management on steps that have been taken to make sure that the scourge is confronted head-on. -TNA Reporter
