After months of keeping things under wraps, South African celebrities and big social media influencers can finally reveal that they have been selected to be part of a Scottish whisky brand alongside soccer legend David Beckham. The stars include actor and presenter Lungile Radu, former television presenter Lelo Boyana and socialite and model Tshepi Vundla. The official launch of the single grain scotch whisky, Haig Club unfolded at News Cafe in Sandton last week with the former soccer player making a special and surprise appearance. Beckham highlighted that the whisky brand is more than just an endorsement deal but it is personal to him. “This is a partnership and we always look for a long-term partnership and I am excited to bring it here. “I am very proud to be here, I’ve been coming here for the past 25 years, most days as a football player but not so much anymore,” he said. Boyana said she did not believe it when called for joining the campaign last year. The beauty said that she was inspired by an opportunity like this. “I realise that working with David Beckham is a once in a lifetime opportunity and so it’s really a privilege and an honour that Diageo SA saw something in me that resonated with Haig Club and the Beckham brand.” – Nontokozo Gxumisa
