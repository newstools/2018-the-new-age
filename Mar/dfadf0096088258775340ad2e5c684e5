Parliament’s standing committees on finance, public accounts, public administration and trade and industry on Wednesday held a second briefing on the Steinhoff matter. The committees noted a claim by the Hawks claim that a case opened against former Steinhoff CEO Markus Jooste in January was little more than malicious compliance and contained little terms of substance. The committees said they suspected that Steinhoff had rushed to open the case because it had to appear before them. However, Steinhoff’s lawyers denied the suspicions, saying that they were cooperating with the Hawks despite the complexities of the case. Standing committee on finance Chairperson Yunus Carrim said the committees had decided to subpoena Jooste and would pursue this matter further through discussions with Parliament’s Legal Services Unit and the office of the speaker. “However, the committees recognise Mr Jooste’s right to a fair defense before a court of law or a hearing of any regulatory or other investigative bodies,” Carrim said. -TNA Reporter
