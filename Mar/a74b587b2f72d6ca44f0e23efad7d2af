Joyous Celebration founder Lindelani Mkhize reportedly spent three days in hospital after suffering a heart attack. It is said that the gospel legend was admitted to the Life Entabeni Hospital in Berea, Durban. Mkhize, who woke up at the hospital and was told that he suffered a heart attack, said: “I’m glad that I’m fine and I’m resting as the doctor instructed.” Joyous Celebration has remained mum about the health scare, as it wanted Mkhize to recover without the attention of the public. The group is currently rehearsing for its Easter celebration as it launches the #MTNJoyous22 #AllForYou album, scheduled to take place at Carnival City from 30 March to 1 April. #MTNJoyous22 #AllForYou Rehearsals.
