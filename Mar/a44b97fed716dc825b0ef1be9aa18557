Former Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke will on Monday release his report on the deaths of mentally ill patients who were removed from Life Esidimeni facilities. The report will be released after months of hearings into the deaths of more than 140 mentally ill patients, who died after being transferred to ill-equipped facilities illegally. Several provincial government officials testified about how they were forced to obey illegal instructions and move the patients. Family members also testified about how badly their mentally ill family members were treated and the terrible condition in which some bodies were found. The arbitration hearings was established by Gauteng Premier David Makhura, with the aim of helping the affected families to find closure. The provincial government has agreed to pay R200 000 each to the families of the deceased, towards funeral expenses. However, Moseneke has emphasised that the figure is not final and he’ll make the final determination. Meanwhile, DA shadow MEC for health Jack Bloom has revealed that the whole inquiry has cost the provincial government R15.7 million so far and a total amount of R47 million is expected to be paid out for all the costs of the alternative dispute resolution process. Bloom has criticised the more than R8.4 million spent on Emoyeni Conference Centre, which was the venue for the hearings. “This is grossly excessive, bearing in mind that Emoyeni is owned by the provincial government which has an arrangement with a private company to rent it out. I will be asking questions on how this can be justified and who has profited from this,” Bloom said. He said financial compensation was necessary but not sufficient for the Esidimeni tragedy, which also requires the criminal prosecution of all those responsible for the deaths. -TNA Reporter
