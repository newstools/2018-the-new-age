A third law firm has expressed its intention to pursue legal action against embattled food company Tiger Brands in relation to the illnesses and deaths caused by the listeriosis outbreak traced to the company’s factory in Limpopo. Another top Johannesburg-based law firm, LHL Attorneys, has reportedly also launched a class action application against Tiger Brands. The law firm is reported to be seeking up to half a billion rand in damages for injury and losses suffered by victims. LHL Attorneys’ class action is reportedly being spearheaded by Wendy Mnguni from Johannesburg who claims to have fallen ill after eating products contaminated with listeria – that was produced by Tiger Brands. This is in addition to action taken by South African activist and human rights attorney Richard Spoor and international food safety firm Marler Clark, which announced that they will lay charges against Tiger Brands over the listeriosis saga as well. The charges are in relation to the deaths of 180 people who died as result of the listeriosis outbreak. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the families of people who died as a result of consuming processed meat contaminated with listeria. Meanwhile, forensic investigator Paul O’Sullivan through Forensics For Justice has also taken steps to open criminal dockets against Tiger Brands in relation to the 180 reported deaths caused by listeriosis, and the recorded 479 related incidents. Following the incident, the Black First Land First (BLF) movement had also laid criminal charges against Enterprise Foods after its factory in Polokwane was identified as the origin of the listeriosis outbreak. BLF leader Andile Mngxitama said that they had opened a murder and attempted murder cases against, Tiger Brands, Enterprise Foods, and Rainbow. -TNA Reporter
