ANC top leaders have today undertaken a journey to the Zion Christian Church (ZCC) headquarters in Moria. The party’s leadership led by President Cyril Ramaphosa, Secretary-General Ace Magashule, Deputy Jesse Duarte and Treasure-General Paul Mashatile undertook the journey as part of its revolutionary pilgrimage to seek spiritual wisdom and counsel. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said the visit was also the first time in 10 years that the 4 million members strong church had accepted a request from the ANC to visit. Ramaphosa thanked the ZCC leader Barnabas Lekganyane for praying for the party’s leadership. “We are here to thank the church for their prayers, we are also here to ask them to continue praying and giving the ANC their blessings as we undertake our mandate to improve the lives of our people. We further extend our gratitude personally to Bishop Lekganyane,” Ramaphosa told the SABC. Mabe said the visit served to reaffirm the ANC’s commitment to the shared values for ethical and moral leadership. -TNA Reporter
