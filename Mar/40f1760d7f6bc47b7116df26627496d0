The expropriation of land needs to be carried out in order for the previously disadvantaged to really feel the fruits of freedom, Deputy President David Mabuza said on Wednesday. “It is also a day which reminds us that freedom and democracy remain meaningless if the majority of South Africans remain trapped without work, jobs or land,” the deputy president said while speaking at a Human Rights Day event in  Sharpeville. Mabuza however admitted that the ANC government took time to deliver on its promise to deal with the land issue. Last month, the EFF tabled a motion for the expropriation of land without compensation, which received support from the ANC, the IFP, its breakaway party the National Freedom Party and other opposition parties, except for the DA. The ANC amended a section of the EFF’s motion before IT could review a section of the Constitution, to pave the way for the expropriation of land without compensation. Meanwhile, former Rural Development and Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti said government’s land audit found that black South Africans owned just 4% of agricultural land, in comparison to the 15% owned by coloured people, 5% by Indian people and 72% by white people. -TNA Reporter
