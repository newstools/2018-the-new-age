Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Athol Trollip has dared the EFF to go ahead with its motion of no confidence against him. Trollip said the DA would not backtrack on its principles. “The move by the EFF will only give them short-term gains but in the long run, voters will reject them. Political parties that survive the test of time have principles that endure time,” Trollip said. This comes after the DA rejected a motion on the expropriation of land without compensation by the EFF in the National Assembly. The EFF’s motion was passed with the support of the ANC, IFP, UDM, and APC. During the debate, EFF Chief Whip Floyd Shivambu said the party’s national leadership had instructed its provincial leadership in the Eastern Cape to start a process of tabling a motion of no confidence against Trollip. He said that if the ANC presented a credible candidate, the EFF would vote with them. However, at the time Trollip said the DA would not be forced into supporting the EFF. “We are not going to be blackmailed into supporting any political ideologies or positions or policies that fly in the face of our own. We did that with the UDM.” “The UDM tried to pressure us not to take decisions to protect their members and we always put principle before personality. So no, we’re not going to be blackmailed by Julius Malema and say either you do this or we will do that,” Trollip said at the time. -Sipho Jack
