THE National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications (NRCS) sent shivers through the Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry when it said that no compulsory specifications existed for processed meat products. On Friday, the committee was briefed on listeriosis and learnt that the NRSC only regulates canned goods and not processed meat products. They were more disturbed when the committee heard that four years ago the processed meat industry complained about high levies and the compulsory specifications on processed meats could not be implemented. The NRCS informed the committee that a standard was developed to regulate meat products but due to disagreements with the industry, the regulation was referred back to the Health Department. The final draft of the processed meat compulsory specifications was accepted during a full stakeholder meeting on March 7, 2014 but the industry argued that the operational costs for levies presented were too high. Not even deliberation by the levy subcommittee members could resolve the stalemate. Reacting to the news committee chairperson Joanmariae Fubbs said: “This is absolutely shocking. What is the cost of a human life? This type of behaviour from the industry cannot be tolerated. “The committee would like a comprehensive list of all those associations and industry partners that argued the levies were too high.” The committee also noted with concern that the hygiene requirements were not part of the proposed regulations and would only be covered in the general requirements for all foodstuffs under the Health Department. Fubbs said they would engage with other committees including health and agriculture to invite them to a joint meeting on this cross-cutting challenge. Following SA’s deadly listeriosis outbreak, which has already claimed 180 lives, the National Consumer Commission ordered a recall of the affected goods last week. vincentc@thenewage.co.za -VINCENT CRUYWAGEN
