Prince’s Paisley Park has announced it will erect a memorial wall in tribute to the late musical icon while sharing additional programming details for next month’s Celebration 2018 event in the star’s honour. For the second year, the Prince4Ever tribute fence will be constructed on the interior grounds of the property in mid-April to mark the second anniversary of the artist’s death. The fence will display fan-donated memorial messages and objects that Paisley Park has saved over the last two years. The wall’s installation is timed to take place ahead of Celebration 2018, a four-day event at Paisley Park honouring Prince’s life and legacy. In addition to previously announced musical guests including longtime Prince collaborator and friend Sheila E. and a new supergroup of the artist’s past collaborators, organizers have just announced 10 speakers to appear at the event, including Revolution members Bobby Z, Dez Dickerson and Matt Fink, musician Gayle Chapman, musician and dancer Wally Safford, photographers Allen Beaulieu and Terry Gydesen, and dancer Tomasina Tate. New this year, an April 21 off-site concert at the nearby Target Center will be included in the Celebration 2018 ticket price and will feature newly remastered and never-before-released audio and video of Prince accompanied live on stage by an all-star ensemble of musicians. Outside the Target Center, another specially erected fence will provide fans attending the concert with another space to add their memorial messages.
