One of the leaders of the controversial Seven Angels Ministry, Banele Mancoba is expected to appear before the Ngcobo Magistrate’s Court in Eastern Cape on Tuesday. The church leader was arrested over the weekend alongside his accomplices following a multi-team police operation. Mancoba is facing a charge of rape, sexual grooming, and sexual exploitation. About 100 women including young girls were rescued from the Seven Angels Ministry church premises last month. It was then alleged that some of these women were kept at the church as sex slaves. These women are alleged to have been brainwashed by the church leaders in accordance with the ‘doctrine’ of the church. They were also allegedly prevented from interacting with the community and had no identification documents, while the young girls were prohibited from attending school. Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba last week announced that the Eastern Cape provincial offices would facilitate a process of issuing documents to these Seven Angels Ministry congregants who were rescued. The arrest follows the investigations into the Ngcobo police shooting tragedy that happened last month. The church was in the center of the Ngcobo police station killings that occurred in the area, where five police officers and a retired soldier were killed. The suspects were later found in the church premises. Seven of the suspects were killed by the police in a shootout at the church while others escaped. -TNA Reporter
