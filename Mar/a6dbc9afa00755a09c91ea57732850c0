Three people have been killed in a crash involving two cars on the N1 between Tobias and the Nyl Plaza tollgate in Limpopo on Thursday. Motorists travelling from south to north have been adviced to take the Mookgopong route to the R101. Chief Director of Traffic in Limpopo Jane Mulaudzi stated that a passenger who was in a BMW passed on and two passengers who were in a Toyota Quantum taxi also passed on. “We urge motorists to remain patient and refrain from making illegal u-turns on the highway as the situation is still complicated,” said Mulaudzi. She also indicated that the cause of the crash is being investigated. Earlier this week Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) spokesperson Simon Zwane said they have deployed traffic officers together with the SAPS on all the major roads that were expected to be congested. “We are aware that schools are closing and people will be going on holiday and we have also taken into account that it is month end and alcohol use will be high, so all roads will be monitored,” Roads that are expected to be congested are the N1 to Polokwane where people will be travelling to Moria, the N3 to Durban, N4 to Mpumalanga and all roads leading to the borders. -TNA Reporter
