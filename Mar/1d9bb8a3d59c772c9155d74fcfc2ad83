Mamelodi Sundowns have advanced to the group stages of the Caf Champions League following their impressive 2 – 0 win over Rayon Sports in the second leg. The Brazilians drew 0 – 0 with Rayon in the first leg in Rwanda. Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane was happy with his team’s performance on the waterlogged pitch due to heavy rain. “What was pleasing for me was the first half on a bad pitch. Rain soaked pitch. These boys showed integrity. These boys fought and the mentality was different from other games we have been playing. “On a pitch like this and they were playing. I like what they did in the first half. I don’t care about the second half because the pitch was okey and we could play our own game. They showed that the can play the champions league under any conditions,” said Mosimane. It looks like the Tshwane based outfit are finding form at the right time as they will be returning to action in the league on Wednesday when they take on Chippa United at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium. Sundowns are at the top of the league table with 43 points – a point ahead of Orlando Pirates who are one game ahead of Mosimane’s side. “What is good is that our combination in front of  Percy, Vila is happening. You know when Percy is not scoring, Vila is coming to the party and score.  Gastón is finding his way. Zwane fights so Shuga and Keke tonight were unbelievable in the midfield under the conditions. “Wayne and Ricardo at the back also solid. Dennis got a save in the first half. He kept us in the game so is good. This is champions league we have to play under any conditions. You don’t complain,” said Mosimane. -TNA Reporter
