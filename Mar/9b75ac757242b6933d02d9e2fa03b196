DA MP Glynnis Breytenbach and her former attorney, Gerhard Wagenaar, were yesterday acquitted on various charges including defeating the ends of justice. The judgment was delivered in the Pretoria North Magistrate’s Court, where Breytenbach and Wagenaar faced charges of contravening the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Act and defeating the ends of justice relating to unauthorised access to and modifying, official laptop computer content. The charges relate to documents deleted in the matter of a mining rights case involving Imperial Crown Trading and Kumba Iron Ore subsidiary Sishen Iron Ore, in which Breytenbach was involved during the time when she worked for the specialised commercial crimes unit within the NPA. Reacting to the judgment, Western Cape Premier Helen Zille said in a tweet: “Great news. There should be a probe into the other side of state capture – the laying of false charges to tarnish the reputation of honest people.” While the DA MP and chief whip John Steenhuisen in a tweet said: “Breytenbach has been acquitted of the trumped up charges against her. Our house needs more MPs like her who are fearless and unafraid to speak truth to power.” The NPA could yesterday not comment on the judgment. –CHARLOTE HLANGWANE|charloteh@thenewage.co.za
