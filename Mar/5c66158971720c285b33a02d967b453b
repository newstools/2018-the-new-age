Former prosecutor and DA member of Parliament Glynnis Breytenbach has vowed to continue fighting following her acquittal by the Pretoria North Magistrates Court on charges of contravening the NPA Act and defeating the ends of justice. Breytenbach was speaking following her and her former attorney Gerhard Wagenaar’s acquittal on Thursday. They were facing charges of contravening the NPA Act and defeating the ends of justice by allegedly shredding documents relating to Breytenbach’s work and deleting her private files from her work laptop during her time as a prosecutor. “We’ve always held the view that this was just a malicious prosecution and was politically driven,” Breytenbach said. DA Federal Chairperson James Selfe concurred with Breytenbach that charges were trumped up from the start and that the magistrate saw through it. “Magistrate Brian Nemavhidi found that Breytenbach had broken no law and that the charges, relating to unauthorised access and changing official laptop contents while she was still at the NPA had no basis,” Selfe said. He said the DA was satisfied and celebrating the fact that that justice had finally prevailed. Meanwhile, prosecutor Raymond Mathenjwa announced that the state intended withdrawing perjury charges against Breytenbach. -TNA Reporter
