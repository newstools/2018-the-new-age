ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa says redeployment of former Police Minister Fikile Mbalula to Luthuli House is not a demotion. Ramaphosa said the party entrusted Mbalula with the responsibility to have the organisation retain power in the upcoming national election. “When we said get out of the Cabinet and run elections, some people thought that we were mad. But are absolutely right, because he is the person who will win us our elections,” Ramaphosa said. He said this on Saturday in Soweto when he engaged with residents after concluding his 5km walk. The president further reiterated party’s position of fighting corruption. “We are rooting out the corrupt elements in our state-owned enterprises. We are going to create a South Africa that all of us can be proud of,” he added. Meanwhile, the party’s deputy president David Mabuza will be in Mpumalanga to encourage first-time voters to register to vote. Mabuza is also expected to do the same project In Gauteng on Sunday in Mamelodi ward 10, 40, 93 and ward 17 in Mahube hall.
