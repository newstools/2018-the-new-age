The DA in the North West has called on Premier Supra Mahumapelo to “do the honourable thing” and resign following allegations of multimillion-rand corruption, which allegedly took place under his leadership. The call comes after a raid at Mahumapelo’s office in Mahikeng by the Hawks, which he on Thursday said he welcomed. The DA said Mahumapelo must be held accountable for his alleged relationship with the Gupta family and his alleged involvement in state capture. DA North West MP Joe McGluwa said the revelation of irregularities relating to R30 million that was allegedly paid to Gupta-linked company Mediosa was just the tip of the iceberg of corruption that had been taking place under Mahumapelo’ leadership. The EFF in the province announced that it would be tabling a motion of no confidence against Mahumapelo. McGluwa said, as the DA, they would support the motion once it was tabled. “The DA will support a proposed motion of no confidence against the premier and we will not hesitate to vote him out. However, it seems that the Speaker is adamant on protecting Mahumapelo as she uses the same delaying tactics as that of her national counterpart Baleka Mbete, delaying the process to debate the motion of no confidence,” McGluwa said. McGluwa said, under the ANC government the North West province had deteriorated and it was now potentially financially bankrupt. He said the DA also called on the ANC to recall Mahumapelo from his position if he refuses to resign because it was under his leadership that the province saw a growing lack of service delivery and instability. “The people of the North West need a government that is transparent and accountable, only the DA can bring this total change to the province.” -TNA Reporter
