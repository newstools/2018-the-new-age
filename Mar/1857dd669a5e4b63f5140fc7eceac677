Leader and founder of the African Democratic Change (ADeC) Makhosi Khoza on Sunday denied media reports that her newly formed political party is crumbling. This comes after reports on Sunday that there is a “split” within the party. According to reports, there are members of the party who are threatening to resign and are allegedly demanding that Khoza recognize some members into party leadership, including former Gauteng EFF leader Lufuno Gogoro. “There is a rumour that ADeC is splitting. There is no split at ADeC. We kicked out those who did not pass the high moral test of ADeC. They have been rejected as members because they are about positions and not people. They also displayed amoral and immoral tendencies,” Khoza said. She said there were some individuals who aspired to use the party as a “vehicle to get parliamentary seats” but they had failed to be considered. “We want an absolutely clean organisation. We rather suffer setbacks now than later. We have learnt valuable lessons from other political formations.” The former ANC member of Parliament (MP) launched her own political party last year following disputes with the ruling party over her criticism of former President Jacob Zuma. She promised then that her new party was to bring change into the political spectrum. Meanwhile, Khoza said Gogoro and some former Black Land First (BLF) members were rejected admission as members of the ADeC. She said they “failed the moral and ethical leadership test” of the organisation. Khoza further alleged that Gogoro and Mpho Ramakatsa are suspected to have opened a bank account in the name of the party. “We are warning members of the public to guard against political imposters. We call on them to desist completely from using the ADeC name and logo.” -TNA Reporter
