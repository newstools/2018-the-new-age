The DA in Gauteng has welcomed a R1.2 million award by retired former Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke to 146 claimants as a result of death and bad treatment of mentally ill patients who were illegally removed from Life Esidimeni facilities. DA shadow MEC of health in Gauteng Jack Bloom was reacting to the report released by Moseneke on the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings, which concluded in February. Bloom said Moseneke’s awards are a stinging rebuke to the Gauteng provincial government which only offered R200 000 in damages under common law and denied that it was liable for breaches of constitutional rights. Moseneke ordered that the provincial government pay families of the deceased R20 000 for their funeral expenses‚ R180 000 for shock and psychological trauma and R1 million in constitutional damages. “The amount to be paid to the claimants is about R175 million in total, which is way more than the R28 million currently budgeted in the current provincial budget in this matter,” Bloom said. He said it was shameful that the provincial government sought to restrict the legitimate claims of relatives of those who died. “Justice Moseneke made clear findings of criminal liability concerning former MEC Qedani Mahlangu and senior officials and the police must follow up on the evidence presented at the arbitration hearings.” Bloom said Moseneke had demonstrated great wisdom and compassion and also set a binding precedent for the dignified treatment of all people in line with the Constitution. -TNA Reporter
