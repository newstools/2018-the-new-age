PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has committed himself to peaceful land reform and has declared there was no need to beat war drums or stir up fears over the issue. Ramaphosa made the comments in the national House of Traditional Leaders at Parliament yesterday, to a debate on his state of the nation address last week. He referred to the vote passed by Parliament on Tuesday to change the Constitution to make land redistribution easier. The vote was about making equitable land redistribution through the expropriation of land. The successful passage of the motion excited many South Africans. black and white, rich and poor, young and old, men and women, he said. He said this was because land reform, hunger and economic justice revolved around land. “Some have become very hopeful, some have become very fearful,” he said. The government would handle the question with responsibility and care. “There will be no smash and grab in our country. That we will not allow.” There were some who said there was no need to talk and there were others who sought to drive fear in the hearts of the international community, he said. Some opponents of land redistribution have even tried to tell international investors it was not safe to invest in South Africa, President Ramaphosa said as he appealed to South Africans to desist from stirring up fear. “This matter is serious. We are making sure we will address it in the most responsible manner.” What this moment required was that people engaged each other and to come up with proposals that would lead to a just and sustainable outcome. Laying down conditions, President Ramaphosa said there was no need to beat the war drum, farming activities must continue “until we find good solutions that will take our country forward”. news@thenewage.co.za
