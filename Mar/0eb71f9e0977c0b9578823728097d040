FORMER president Kgalema Motlanthe has joined the board of the Brazzaville Foundation to bolster its conflict resolution work. The chairperson of the foundation, Jean-Yves Oliver, hailed Motlanthe‘s decision to come on board as a “huge honour”. “His enduring commitment to democracy and his outstanding, dynamic leadership will be of great value to fostering peaceful resolution of conflicts – a pillar of the foundation’s mission.” Oliver said in welcoming Motlanthe. The foundation said that among some of the various qualities that warranted admiration were Motlanthe’s leadership skills, describing him as a patient and considerate decision maker. “Although now retired from political life, he heads a foundation in his name committed to social causes, including education and human rights,” the foundation said. The Brazzaville Foundation is an independent and neutral facilitator between warring parties in Africa and other parts of the world. Based in London the foundation falls under the royal patronage of Prince Michael of Kent. Some of the foundation’s activities include the Congo Basin project where it finances sustainable development projects and the promotion of renewable resources in the Congo. Another project that the foundation is undertaking is the West African Migration project and proposes an initiative which will detail migration from the point of view of West African countries and identify what actions these countries could take to strengthen economies in the region in a bid to reduce increased outward migration from the continent. –HLONI MASHIGO|hlonim@thenewage.co.za
