Award-winning singer and praise poet Jessica Mbangeni fell victim to identity theft after a scammer used her MTN contact unlawfully. Mbangeni announced to her supporters and business associates that her MTN mobile had been a victim of identity theft and that a scammer pretending to be her, using her MTN mobile number, requested money from people. Mbangeni, in a statement, said she had filed an affidavit at the Mandeville police station in west-central Jamaica, in an effort to assist her case against the South African-based scamming operation. “When your own name is at the core of your personal business and squarely in the public eye, it is very hurting for someone to dupe people and make up lies to embezzle money from your business associates and friends for selfish gain as the act has a negative effect on your reputation and relationships with the public,” Mbangeni said. Mbangeni said the ordeal has devastated her mind and brought inconsistency to her business and has led to the breaking down of a relationship with a client. -TNA Reporter
