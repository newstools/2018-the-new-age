The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said they cannot allow Minister of Energy Jeff Radebe to perpetuate the stealing of money from the SOEs. Following the ruling made by the Pretoria High Court to stop Radebe from signing of 27 IPPs power purchase agreements, NUM has expressed its appreciation. NUM’s national spokesperson Livhuwani Mammburu said the union condemns the use of political office for personal wealth accumulation directly or indirectly. Last year NUM embarked on the fight against the IPPs in line with objectives of protecting jobs in the country and challenged the government to review its implementations with success. “We view this capitalist IPPs deal as a backdoor privatisation of 42% of Eskom by 2030 masquerading as the implementation of clean energy.” Mammburu said NUM and Cosatu have successfully fought against the privatisation of Eskom before and are ready to fight again. “The proposed agreements are nothing but daylight robbery and will cause high scale job losses in the energy, mining, transport and all other sectors in the supply chain. “If ANC led government and Eskom is going to continue with this madness, NUM will be pushed to a total shutdown.” -TNA Reporter
