The Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) has attached a house in Klerksdorp, North West that was being used as a brothel and drug dealing. This is after the AFU submitted that various provisions of the Sexual Offences Act, Drugs, and Drug Trafficking Act and the Prevention and Combating of Trafficking in Persons Act were violated in the house. According to the AFU, the house was hijacked by drug dealers and human traffickers. The occupants had since tormented the community and local authorities in the area. “The evidence reveals that one Charles Chukwukere Okorie, a Nigerian national, was arrested on or about 16 December 2016 at the property in connection with various illegal activities that took place there. On 2 March 2017, following another police raid Michael Nzubechukwu, another Nigerian who is also an illegal immigrant, was arrested at the house. “The house at issue was used by Okorie and his co-perpetrators largely as a brothel. Willing participants and victims of the offenses were trafficked into the house. Most of them were kept against their will and sexually exploited. The Hawks rescued many of the victims, including minor children,” AFU statement read. Early last year the Matlosana Local Municipality launched separate legal proceedings before the Mahikeng High Court with a view to have certain illegal structures erected on the property demolished. At the same time, Gauteng regional spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said the AFU used the new information to further strengthen its case adding that they have since submitted to the Court. -TNA Reporter
