AfriForum has welcomed Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter Dutton’s commentary that South African farmers’ applications to immigrate to Australia will possibly enjoy priority attention. Dutton said this is a serious charge against the South African government. Deputy CEO of AfriForum responsible for international liaison Alana Bailey said that Dutton’s attitude, as representative of a successful international democracy, should be the food of thought for the government. “It must serve as a warning that South Africa runs the risk to lose even more productive, loyal citizens should their concerns about issues such as property rights not be listened to in earnest and actions not be launched to address problems such as crime in the country.” He said that Dutton has also admitted that the concern of white South Africans is just as valid as that of any other citizen. “However, the South African authorities are only too glad to hold the community as scapegoats for problems in the country and treat them as second-class citizens.” AfriForum is of the view that solutions for the what Afrikaners and other minorities experience in the country must be found and a future must be created at the southernmost tip of Africa wherein the minorities can exist in freedom, safety and prosperity. The organisation further welcomes any international pressure that highlights the challenges that minorities face and helps to convince the government to prioritise these. -TNA Reporter
