Free State ANC provincial task team (PTT) said the preparations for the provincial conference are well on track. PTT’s spokesperson Thabo Meeko said the conference is convened for 17 March, adding that all Branch General Meetings (BGM) will be concluded by next week. “The preparations towards conference are well on track. Remember the instructions before our conference reconvenes, we must convene thirteen branches. Our deadline is next week Tuesday.” Meeko further said all branches were briefed and are aware of the date of the conference. This comes after 400 ANC branch members protested at the party’s headquarters Luthuli House on Monday. Members were protesting to raise their dissatisfaction over the PTT in the province which they believed to be sympathetic to ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule. According to reports protesters were addressed by the party’s national organiser Senzo Mchunu and general manager Febe Potgieter-Gqubule. The National Executive Committee disbanded the provincial leadership after the Bloemfontein high court nullified the conference outcome. The PEC was challenged by members believed to be supporting ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa. This year’s conference will be held in the eastern Free State in Botshabelo at Black mountain resort. At the same time, former Mangaung mayor Thabo Manyoni will be contesting the chairmanship position with the current convener Paseka Nompondo, former party treasurer and speaker Mxolisi Dukwana. Current Sports and recreation MEC Mmathabo Leeto is also believed to be in the running for chairmanship position. Both Leeto and Dukwana hail from the second biggest region in the province Lejweleputswa. It is believed that both leaders enjoy large support in the region, however, sources close to leaders say supporters of both Dukwane and Manyoni are divided as to who must be the leader. Some believe that both leaders must sit down and decide who become chairman and deputy. -Sipho Jack
