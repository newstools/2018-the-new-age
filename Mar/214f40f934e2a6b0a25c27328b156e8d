SAA on Thursday cancelled a flight from New York to Johannesburg due to bad weather. The national carrier announced that it had cancelled its SA 204 flight from New York (JFK) to Johannesburg scheduled for Thursday. SAA spokesperson Tlali Tlali said: “We have decided to cancel today’s flight from Johannesburg to New York and tomorrow’s flight returning from New York to Johannesburg due to adverse weather conditions such as snow and freezing rain aggravated by gusting winds. The weather conditions make it unsafe to operate flights as conditions are outside our operating limits.” “South African Airways regrets any inconvenience caused to our customers as a result of the cancellation of flights. We have the best interests of our passengers at heart and trust that our discerning customers will appreciate that this decision was based on safety as the main consideration.” Tlali also stated that the airline would be monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis and be in constant liaison with US authorities, and would be able to resume flights once the situation improved.
