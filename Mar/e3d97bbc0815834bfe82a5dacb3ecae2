The DA has welcomed the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Zweli Mkhize’s announcement to declare drought as a national disaster. DA shadow Minister of Cooperative and Traditional Affairs Kevin Mileham said for the past 2 years the party has called for the water crisis to be declared a national disaster but it fell on deaf ears. “The declaration of the national disaster will unlock the disaster relief funds which will assist in dealing with this crisis. That is why we have welcomed this announcement but also question why it took so long.” He said in February the water crisis affecting the Western Cape, Northern Cape and the Eastern Cape was re-classified a national disaster. “All that was left was for the Cabinet to declare the national disaster to activate the release of the much-needed funds to the affected provinces.” Now that Mkhize has confirmed that the water crisis will be responded to with greater urgency, the party said that the disaster funds must be released urgently and the national government must support efforts to mitigate the water crisis. -TNA Reporter
