The ANC has promised to table a motion calling for the nationalisation of the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb), as resolved by its elective conference in December 2017. The announcement comes less than 24 hours after the party withdrew a notice to table a similar motion in Parliament on Tuesday. The party on Tuesday, in a statement, said it welcomed the withdrawal by its caucus in Parliament. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said, as the party, they believed the withdrawal of the motion would deepen the content of the envisaged motion and also created an adequate platform for the ANC to place a motion that placed South Africa on the path of radical socio-economic transformation based on job creation and equitable wealth, asset and income distribution on the agenda. “The ANC affirms its intent to re-table the motion, which will be fully aligned with the outcomes of its 54th National Conference on the Reserve Bank and affirms its independence in performing its functions,” Mabe said. Mabe said they also note the historical anomaly of the Bank having private shareholders, and thus consequently advocates for 100% state ownership. He said the ANC was of a firm view that the attainment of Radical Socio-Economic Transformation would be guided by continued engagement with all sections of society. -TNA Reporter
