The EFF leader Julius Malema on Wednesday said that the racists should go to Australia and leave the keys of their tractors and property behind for black people to occupy. Malema was addressing a crowd during a Human Rights rally in Mpumalanga. Following the Australian Minister of Home Affairs Peter Dutton’s comment to fast track white farmers’ visas, Malema said if they want to go they must go. He reportedly said a racist country like Australia is saying that the EFF wants to kill white farmers, so they must go. Malema also added that people misunderstood EFF members on the issue of expropriation of land without compensation. “Let us talk about how we are going to expropriate land without compensation. We don’t know violence, we know negotiation,” he was quoted. Those who are going, he said, should depart quietly but leave the keys of their tractors because South Africans must work the land. -TNA Reporter
