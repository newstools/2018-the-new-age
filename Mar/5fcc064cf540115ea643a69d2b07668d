National Transport Movement (NTM) General-Secretary Ephraim Mphahlele on Monday claimed that the organisation had proof that former Prasa CEO, Lucky Montana orchestrated the burning of train coaches during an NTM strike. Mphahlele made the accusations while speaking to talk radio station 702. About 700 workers dismissed by the agency five years ago, and due to be reinstated after winning a court case, have accused Montana of being the mastermind behind the torching of trains. “The reason why Lucky Montana orchestrated the torching of trains was primarily because he was not happy with the fact that the National Transport Movement had been driving a campaign that led to an exposé of a corruption on his part,” Mphahlele said. Meanwhile, the former Prasa CEO has dismissed the allegation against him. “I will not entertain such allegations. I was a group chief executive officer and did not have direct access to employees,” Montana reportedly said. At the same time, Mphahlele said NTM had proof that Montana was the brains behind the torching. According to the NTM general-secretary, Montana is alleged to have instructed security managers to torch the trains at the time that NTM was striking. He said this was done so that NTM members could be blamed as the ones behind the torching of the trains. Mphahlele said the proof has been forwarded to Prasa management, for them to take action against those implicated. He said the matter had also been reported to the police on numerous occasions but “the police are not doing anything” about it. -TNA Reporter
