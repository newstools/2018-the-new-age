Two North West farmersÂ accused of kidnapping and killing a teenager in Coligny pleaded not guilty in the North West High Court in Mahikeng on Tuesday. Pieter Doorewaard, 26 and Philip Schutte, 34, pleaded not guilty on charges of murder, intimidation, kidnapping, unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, theft and pointing of a firearm. They are accused of the murder of 16-year-old Matlhomola Mosweu in April 2017. They are alleged to have apprehended the teenager on the accusation that he stole a sunflower from their farm. According to their version of events, the farmers had placed Mosweu at the back of their bakkie with the intention to report him to the police. The teenager allegedly then jumped out of the moving car, leading to injuries to his neck. Mosweu later died on his way to a hospital. The state, however, alleges that the two killed Mosweu at the Scotland informal settlement in Coligny. They are currently out on a bail of R5 000 each. -TNA Reporter
