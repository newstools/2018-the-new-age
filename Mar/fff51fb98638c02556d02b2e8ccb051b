The Democratic Alliance (DA) has welcomed the three-year jail sentence for former estate agent Vicki Momberg. The DA said the landmark ruling has affirmed that racism goes against the principles of constitutional democracy and this decision should, therefore, be welcomed by all. Momberg on Wednesday was sentenced to a three-year jail sentence, one of which was suspended, after she was found guilty on crimen injuria charges by the Randburg Magistrates court. In 2016, Momberg was captured on video hurling racist insults at black police officers who were trying to help her after her car was burgled. DA’s National Spokesperson Refiloe Nt’sekhe said they were hoping that the ruling would be a deterrent to those who may harbor any racist sentiments. “The court has affirmed that racism goes against the principles of constitutional democracy and this decision should, therefore, be welcomed by all. “Racism has no place in our democracy and those found guilty of racism and racist acts must face the consequences.” Nts’ekhe said as the DA, they hold the view that there is no room for racists in South Africa and will continue to work together with all South Africans to ensure that a non-racial society is built. She said the DA would not tolerate any form of discrimination from any individual irrespective of their race. -TNA Reporter
