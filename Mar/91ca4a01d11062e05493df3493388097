Tshwane MMC for roads and transport Sheila Senkubuge on Monday announced that a task team had been established to assess the suspension of commuter rail services on the Mamelodi corridor. “I am pleased to report that the city of Tshwane, Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa), commuter rail operator Metrorail and other stakeholders have agreed to form a task team to help resolve the current train service challenges on the Mamelodi corridor following Prasa’s announcement that train services along the Mamelodi corridor will remain suspended until further notice,” Senkubuge said. This comes after Prasa confirmed that a driver was stripped naked, hit with a brick and dragged into thickets as part of a sustained attack on trains along the corridor and that a further 10 employees were attacked as well. Senkubuge said the task team would work closely with commuter forums and community leaders to find solutions to the challenges faced by Metrorail on the corridor. No train service is currently running from Koedoespoort and Pienaarspoort stations. “Members of the public need to realise that vandalising public property will not resolve any of their grievances. Instead, this will leave them in a worse off position as has happened now following Prasa’s decision to suspend train services.” The city of Tshwane has called on commuters to exercise calm and restraint while the task team works on finding a lasting solution to the current situation. -TNA Reporter
