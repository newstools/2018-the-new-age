On Wednesday, Gauteng MECs for community safety and roads and transport visited Ngcobo’s family. The Department community safety stated that the purpose of the visit was to offer the provincial government’s condolences and to also give support to Ngcobo’s family. Both Community safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane and roads and transport MEC Ismail Vadi have condemned the brutal murder in the strongest possible terms and have called on law enforcement to leave no stone unturned in bringing the perpetrators to book. “During the visit, the family did indicate that they had information that can help the police crack the case and they also expressed dissatisfaction that there are witnesses who are willing to say what they saw on that day but the police have not interviewed them,” Nkosi-Malobane said. -TNA Reporter
