The Constitutional Court will on Tuesday make a ruling on an application brought by the Social Security Agency of South Africa (Sassa) to extend an already invalid contract between it and Cash Pay Services (CPS). Sassa wants the court to extend the contract by a further six months in order to have what it calls a smooth transition to the South African Post Office as a new social grant dispenser. Last year, the court ordered the extension of the contract by a further 12 months, despite acknowledging that it was invalid. Former Minister of Social Services Bathabile Dlamini has been accused of being a stumbling block to finding a new service provider. Pressure group Black Sash previously told the court that Sassa’s proposed plan has inadequate safeguards for protecting beneficiaries’ personal data, which leaves them vulnerable to exploitation. -TNA Reporter
