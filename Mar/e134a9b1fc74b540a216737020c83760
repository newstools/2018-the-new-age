Present during the inspection to the site on Monday was the eyewitness who had testified in court that he saw the two farmers push the teenager out of a moving vehicle. The eyewitness also showed authorities an area where he said the farmers took him and intimidated him after they realised he had witnessed the incident. The two are accused of killing Moshoeu in Coligny last year. On Monday, they showed the judge the spot of on the road where Moshoeu died. During their previous appearance, last week, both accused pleaded not guilty on charges of murder, intimidation, kidnapping, unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition, theft and pointing of a firearm. They are alleged to have apprehended the teenager on the accusation that he stole a sunflower from their farm. Meanwhile, the farmers said they had placed Moshoeu at the back of their bakkie with the intention to report him to the police.
