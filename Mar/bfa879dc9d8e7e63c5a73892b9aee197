A 36-year-old female motorist was raped on the road between Buchbuckridge and Lydenburg in Mpumalanga, while trying to help half-naked woman. The motorist was reportedly driving on Wednesday evening when she spotted a woman trying to stop her, signaling that she needed help. Police spokesperson Sergeant Gerald Sedibe said when she stopped to help, the half naked woman ran into the bushes while an unknown man came out with a firearm. “The suspect got into her car and instructed her to drive towards the Injaka dam, lead her to the bushes and called his friend. “As she tried to escape, the suspect fired a short and forced her to undress and they took turns in raping her.” Sedibe said the men further took her belongings before fleeing the scene in a green Volkswagen. “No arrests have been made yet, however, investigations are underway.” -TNA Reporter
