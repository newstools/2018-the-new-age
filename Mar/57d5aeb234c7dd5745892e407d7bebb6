The Gauteng Department of Education has expressed its concern about a spate of robberies taking place in schools especially in Atteridgeville, Pretoria. It is alleged that criminals broke into Masizane Primary School, where they stole seven computers, two tablets and all National School Nutrition Programme (NSNP) Stock on Friday. Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said it is unfortunate that in the same morning Thohoyandou Primary School was also hit by the robbers who stole four computers and all nutritional stock. “We strongly believe that there is a syndicate operating in the area because these criminal activities started on Tuesday, where there another break-in at Flavius Mareka Secondary School and the entire nutritional stock was taken.” The department has notified the police and criminal cases have been opened accordingly. “We strongly condemn these criminal acts which seek to undermine our effort to provide food to our children at school. Most of the learners at the said schools are from disadvantaged communities and as such we must provide food to them every day. “We urge the community members to bring any information that might assist the police to apprehend culprits. Our schools cannot afford to be a haven for criminals. It is unacceptable,” -TNA Reporter
