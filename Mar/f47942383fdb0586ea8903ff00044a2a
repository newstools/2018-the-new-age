The South African Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 3.1% in the fourth quarter, according to Statistics SA. Statistics SA said the 1.3% economy growth exceeded National Treasury’s expectation of 1% growth, which former Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba announced during his budget speech in February. “After a wobbly start to 2017, which saw economic activity contract in the first quarter, the economy saw sustained growth for the remainder of the year. The fourth quarter experienced the highest growth rate of 2017, with the economy expanding by 3.1% quarter-on-quarter.” “The strengthening in economic activity over 2017 was partly driven by an agriculture industry bouncing back from one of the worst droughts in recent history. A bumper maize crop and recovery in other agricultural commodities saw agriculture production rise by 17.7% in 2017 compared with 2016,” Stats SA said. According to Stats SA, finance and mining industries also contributed positively to GDP growth. The agency said mining growth was spurred on, in part, by increased production of manganese ore, chrome, and iron ore. The second largest contributor was the trade sector, mostly as a result of a rise in activities related to retail, wholesale and motor trade. The agency said although there was growth in the economy there was a quarter-on-quarter decline in the fourth quarter, which was largely driven by a fall in the production of gold and platinum group metals (PGMs). -TNA Reporter
