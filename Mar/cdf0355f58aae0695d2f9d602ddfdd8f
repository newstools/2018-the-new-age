ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe on Tuesday said the land issue has to go through the relevant structures, such as Parliament before it can be implemented. Mabe said there would be an opportunity through the constitutional review committee on inputs, to tackle the land expropriation issue. “The land issue can’t be an open-ended resolution; the process has to go through relevant structures which in this regard is Parliament. We already have a subcommittee that is working on various modality on the implementation of land expropriation,” the spokesperson said. He further said the governing party wanted to ensure that the land expropriation process is conducted in a responsible manner. Mabe also cautioned those who were using the land issue as an opportunity to land grab, adding that those who were engaging in such illegal activity were undermining the process. “We need to look at what has been done on land reform and what still needs to be done to ensure the productive use of the land by our people.” Last month, the EFF tabled a motion for the expropriation of land without compensation, which received support from the ANC, the IFP, its breakaway party the National Freedom Party and other opposition parties, except for the DA. The ANC amended a section of the EFF’s motion before it could review a section of the Constitution, to pave the way for the expropriation of land without compensation. Meanwhile, former Rural Development and Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti said government’s land audit found that black South Africans owned just 4% of agricultural land, in comparison to the 15% owned by coloured people, 5% by Indian people and 72% by white people. -TNA Reporter
