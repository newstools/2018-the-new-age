Democratic Alliance MP and Shadow Communications Minister Phumzile Van Damme has defended her party following accusations of racial divisions within the party. There have been reports that the race issue in the DA has again come to the fore after a few members questioned the use of the concept of diversity. “It is a pity that this battle of ideas in the DA is racialised and black DA supporters painted as supportive of a specific policy viewpoint, and white supporters, another,” she said. A tabled motion to amend the party’s constitution to include diversity as a value is believed to be the bone of contention. This is expected to be debated in the upcoming DA’s congress. “We are all individuals capable of thought beyond our skin colour. I happen to agree that the idea of diversity as a value is not inimical to liberalism. This idea, I’m sure, will be debated thoroughly on the Congress floor by delegates of all races. I look forward to the debate. In the current debate in today’s newspapers, I know many white DA members who agree that “diversity” should be included in the Constitution as a value, and similarly, Black delegates who disagree,” she wrote. Van Damme says that she believes the “diversity clause” in the DA Constitution will be drafted in a manner that all delegates agree. However fears that “it will be painted black Van Damme white Davis, because all we are, is our skin colour” You won’t see that on front pages because it doesn’t support the narrative that there is some sort of race war in SA. Politicians bankrupt of morality & ideas will of course seek to divide & conquer to exploit. SAns see through this &that’s why those parties will remain below 10% — Phumzile Van Damme (@zilevandamme) March 25, 2018 -TNA Reporter
