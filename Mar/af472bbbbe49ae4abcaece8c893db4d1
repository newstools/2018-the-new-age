A 21-year-old suspect has been arrested in connection with the murder of one on-duty police officer and wounding another in Sunnyside, Pretoria on Friday. The police on Sunday said the two officers were conducting stop-and-search operations in the area when they were attacked by the suspect. The suspect then fled the scene, after the incident. “Our trio task team followed up on information and traced the 21-year-old suspect to a student residence in Sunnyside, Pretoria where the suspect was then arrested on Saturday afternoon – less than 24 hours after the incident,” Gauteng police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said. The Gauteng Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Deliwe de Lange thanked the police and witnesses for their role in the arrest of the suspect. “We hope that this will assist the family towards reconciling with the loss of their loved one, while we allow the law to take its course,” de Lange said. The suspect will be facing charges of murder and attempted murder, for the death of the 34-year-old police officer and for wounding the other 41-year-old officer, who is recovering in hospital. The suspect will appear in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Peters said the police were still investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident. -TNA Reporter
