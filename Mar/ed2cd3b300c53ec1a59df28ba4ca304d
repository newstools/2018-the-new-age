With the bail hearing in the case against Cebolenkosi Gift Philani Ntuli scheduled for 7 and 8 March, DNA results have confirmed the charred remains found in a cane field near New Hanover in KwaZulu-Natal in January belong to Siam Lee. On Wednesday, provincial police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said the identity had been confirmed with the use of comparative samples from Lee’s mother. It is alleged that Ntuli kidnapped Lee on 4 January outside a house on Margaret Mayton Avenue, Durban North and threatened to shoot her. Her burnt body was discovered by a farmer two days later. Ntuli, 29, was arrested on 17 January and faces 16 charges, including murder, rape, kidnapping and robbery with aggravating circumstances. -TNA Reporter
