The ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) has elected human settlement MEC Sisi Ntombela as the new Free State Premier. During a briefing on Wednesday, Ntombela thanked the organisation for putting its faith in her, adding that things would not be easy going forward. She said all ANC deployees derived their mandate from the 54th National Congress, pledging that she would also concentrate on delivering on the mandate. “The important mandate is to unite ANC members. So, I am going to try my level best to unite the Free Staters,” the newly premier-elect said. Ntombela is currently Deputy President of the ANC Women’s League. She is believed to be a staunch supporter of ANC Secretary-General ACE Magashule. It is widely reported that Magashule played a critical role in her election as Women’s League deputy president. Under both her leadership and ANCWL President Bathabile Dlamini a campaign was spearheaded to install former African Union (AU) chair Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma to take over from former President Jacob Zuma. Ntombela’s announcement as the candidate to replace Magashule dispels all rumours that suggested that sports, arts and culture MEC Mathabo Leeto would take over from the outgoing premier. On Tuesday, the DA described Leeto as someone who was not credible to replace Magashule. Through a statement, the party said its concern came after police confirmed to one of its members at the National Council of Provinces, George Michalakis, that the charges against the MEC were indeed reinstated.  -Sipho Jack
