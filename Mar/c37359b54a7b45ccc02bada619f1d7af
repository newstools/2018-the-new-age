The Mpumalanga Legislature on Thursday visited the family of two children who were brutally killed in February. The visit came as the legislature seeks to propose a law specific to albinism killings. Gabisile Shabani, 13, who was living with albinism and her one-year-old cousin Nkosikhona Ngwenya were kidnapped from their home by armed robbers in January. Shabani’s body was found buried in a shallow grave in Cullinan. Her head and some of her body parts were missing and it is reported that they were taken to Swaziland. Meanwhile, Ngwenya’s body was found near the N4 Highway outside Emalahleni. On Wednesday, Mpumalanga SAPS confirmed that three more suspects had been arrested. The three appeared in the Witbank Magistrate’s Court. One of the suspects was released and two others remanded in custody. Themba Thubane and Knowledge Mhlanga have been charged with two counts of murder, two of kidnapping, two of conspiracy to kidnap and violation of a corpse. Meanwhile, traditional healer Thokozani Msibi, 32, has been denied bail and 24-year-old Mthobisi Brilliant Mkhize’s formal bail application never happened as he awaits a state-funded lawyer. -TNA Reporter
