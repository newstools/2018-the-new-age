South African activist and human rights attorney Richard Spoor and international food safety firm Marler Clark will lay charges against food product Tiger Brands over the listeriosis saga. This is in relation to the deaths of 180 people who died as result of the listeriosis outbreak. “Richard Spoor incorporated attorneys have teamed up with United States (US) food safety law firm Marler Clark to file class-action lawsuit against Richard Spoor Tiger Brands on behalf of the families of the people that died after eating processed meat contaminated listeria produced and distributed by Enterprise foods in Polokwane and on behalf of people who contracted listeria but survived,” reads the statement.  This follows an announcement by Minister of Health Aaron Motsoaledi, who last week said investigations into the outbreak of the deadly listeriosis disease pointed to the Polokwane Enterprise factory as the source. The source of the listeriosis outbreak was traced to polony products of Enterprise Foods and Rainbow Chicken. Following the findings by the Department of Health, a recall of the affected products was initiated. Meanwhile, legal action has already been taken against the embattled food company. The Black First Land First movement last week laid two criminal charges against Enterprise Foods ‏and Rainbow Chicken and Tiger Brands, one for murder and one for attempted murder. -TNA Reporter
