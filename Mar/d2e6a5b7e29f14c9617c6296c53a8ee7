KwaZulu-Natal provincial task team (PTT) coordinator Sihle Zikalala has distanced himself from a statement calling for the support of former president Jacob Zuma as he appears in court which have been attributed to him. The statement called for the mass support for the former President as a he appears at the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Durban next month on the 16 charges of corruption, money laundering, fraud and racketeering in relation to the arms deal. The charges were recently reinstated by the NPA. “Cde Zikalala has on several occasions stated categorically that he will abide by the ANC National Executive Committee decision on the matter.” reads part of an ANC KZN statement. During the weekend, ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule said that the party had resolved that those pledging to support Zuma or other members facing charges can do so ‘in their individual capacity’ and not as representatives of the party. The statement that was titled  “support for President Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Nxamalala Mhlanganyelwa Zuma” was issued on Monday during a press briefing organised by people who described themselves as representatives of business forums within and outside KwaZulu-Natal. The ANC in KZN says that this statement was “not issued by the African National Congress Interim Coordinator in KwaZulu-Natal, Sihle Zikalala, as it is claimed on social networks.” -TNA Reporter
