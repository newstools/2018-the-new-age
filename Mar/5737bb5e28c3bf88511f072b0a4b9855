Forensic pathologists affiliated to the South African Liberated Public Sector Workers Union (Salipswu) are denying that they have embarked on an unprotected strike and instead all they have done is “suspend” some services until their demands are met. This comes as bodies continue to pile up across government mortuaries in Gauteng after pathologists downed tools last week Wednesday. According to a number of reports, the workers are demanding from the department of health that they be formally trained and formal qualification be issued to them upon completion of the training. The move if successful would lead to an increase in workers current salaries. Speaking to news channel ANN7, spokesperson for the union Victor Chukudu said that what its affiliates were doing was not, in fact, a strike but rather an attempt to get the Health Department to fulfil promises made to them. “What is happening here is that they are trying to concientise the department to implement what was agreed upon in the bargaining council as one of the resolutions,” said Chukudu. He added that currently, workers have embarked on a suspension of dissection as well as other procedures. “What they need is for the department to implement the training they were promised,” he said. According to reports, the Gauteng Department of Health says it has nearly reached the end of the negotiation process with the union. The current actions by Salipswu only add to The Gauteng Health departments woes after five unions including the Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (Denosa) are set to embark on a major shutdown of health services in the province on Friday over nonpayment of bonuses. -TNA Reporter
