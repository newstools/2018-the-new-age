Eskom has bared suspended Head of Legal Affairs Suzanne Daniels  from returning to work by slapping her with new charges. Last week, the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration(CCMA) dismissed Daniels’ suspension by the previous Eskom board, ruling that it was unfair and that the parastatal was guilty of unfair labour practice by trying to suspend her in October and December 2017. It also ruled that Daniels be paid five months’ pay, as compensation and that she be allowed to return to work on Monday. However, Daniels was on Friday served with new disciplinary charges which relate to alleged serious misconduct, which she is said to have committed, among other things, distribution of confidential information, settlement of the McKinsey/Trillian matter and payments made to McKinsey and Trillian. The charges also include her involvement in the Optimum and Tegeta prepayments and guarantee issued by Eskom. “The new board is aware of the actions which Daniels took in dealing with the McKinsey/Trillian matter in August to October 2017, including investigating payments to these entities and issuing a letter of demand regarding these matters on behalf of Eskom.” “These were commendable actions by Ms Daniels, however, notwithstanding these actions, it is still necessary for Eskom to address Ms Daniels’ actions and conduct in relation to the serious matters contained in the additional charges of misconduct against her,” Eskom said in a statement. The parastatal said Daniels was given an opportunity to make representation to the new board on why she should not be suspended and an announcement will be made in due course. -TNA Reporter
