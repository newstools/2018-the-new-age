Department of Home Affairs spokesperson, Mayihlome Tshwete has confirmed on Monday that Minister Malusi Gigaba has instructed his Director-General Mkuseli Apleni to investigate the possibilities of revoking businessman Ajay Gupta’s permanent residency. The spokesperson said that Home Affairs would make an announcement later this week regarding the steps that the department will be taking in relation to the matter. ” That’s what the minister has directed the Director-General to do, to investigate whether or not there is a possibility of revoking his permanent residency. As you know, our law is quite clear on areas which you can revoke permanent residency or even citizenship, it requires for one to be convicted of a crime,” he said. The move allegedly follows a meeting that Gigaba had with President Cyril Ramaphosa who wanted to know what action that the department is taking against Ajay. ‘What the minister has asked the Director-General to check is on what grounds can we revoke the permanent residency of Ajay Gupta,” said Tshwete. Ajay was declared a fugitive by the police following failure to make contact with the Hawks, who had issued a warrant for his arrest.
