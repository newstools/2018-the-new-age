The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) has permanently closed the Hercules and Innovative testing centres. This comes after more than 60 traffic officials were arrested since the beginning of this year, for alleged corruption and bribery. RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said that owners of these centres were ordered to hand over the certificates of registration to the Department of Transport and cease further operation. “Those implicated in alleged corruption and bribery include traffic officers, South African Police Service (SAPS) members and vehicle examiners from different provinces,” Zwane said. Meanwhile, four employees of a private Johannesburg vehicle testing station are due to appear in the Johannesburg Commercial Crimes Court on charges relating to the fraudulent issuing of vehicle roadworthy certificates. The suspects, two men and two women aged 60, 57, 38 and 24, were arrested at the Lincoln Vehicle Testing Station by a team of corruption busters consisting of the Road Traffic Management Corporation’s National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit, the South African. The arrests followed months of investigation in which the four were observed issuing roadworthy certificates for vehicles that they were not physically presented to the station for inspection. -TNA Reporter
