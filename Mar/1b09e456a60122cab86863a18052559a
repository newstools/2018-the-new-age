THE Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) has slammed what they called the deafening silence of Police Minister Bheki Cele on the SAPS forensic Investigator alleged to have abused two Grade 3 pupils at the AB Xuma Primary School in Orlando, Soweto. The alleged perpetrator is part of a team investigating sexual assault cases at the school. “The PAC is saddened and disturbed to learn that a policeman is implicated in molesting two innocent school kids. “What disturbs us most is that the perpetrator is a man who was supposed to ensure safety of our kids against those who may harm or hurt them,” national spokesperson Kenneth Mokgatlhe said. Mokgatlhe said former police minister Fikile Mbalula understood that criminals were not frightened by empty talk. The New Age’s attempts to get hold of Cele yesterday proved futile. The PAC further said: “Bheki Cele should get his house in order before he can claim to sweep our streets. We have many dangerous criminals who are parading as officers in blue uniforms. These are people who lead criminals in the street and continue to take bribes from poor South Africans,” Mokgatlhe said. He said they wanted to see the “loudhailer” Cele do something to root out corruption in the SAPS and bring back integrity and confidence. “Our people have absolutely lost faith in the law-enforcement agencies because of misconduct of criminals who want us to believe that they are cops while we know that they are gangsters,” Mokgatlhe said. “A person entrusted with protecting children has violated their trust and that of their parents. This man should meet the full might of the law.” Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said. –HLONI MASHIGO
