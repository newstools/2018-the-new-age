 The government said it welcomed Moody’s decision to affirm South Africa’s long-term foreign and local currency debt ratings at ‘Baa3’ and to also revise the outlook to stable from negative, the Treasury said in a statement. Last year rating agency Moody’s decided to place the sovereign’s credit rating under review for a possible downgrade. Moody’s said the reason for its decision was that it noted: “Moody’s indicate that steady progress in meeting the objectives set out in the President’s State of the Nation Address is essential for the country’s economic and fiscal prospects to be sustained. They further note that political, policy and practical challenges of meeting diverse economic, social and fiscal objectives cannot be underestimated,” the Treasury statement read. Treasury said Government had regular engagements with the rating agency both prior and following the 2018 budget presentation and as part of the investor roadshow. “To improve South Africa’s investment and economic prospects, the government continues to work diligently on practical steps to provide the necessary policy certainty such as the finalisation of mining legislation,” the statement said. “Through the SONA the President expressed strong commitment and will to fast-track the implementation and finalisation of key sectoral structural reforms as well as reforms to State-Owned Companies. “Collaboration between government, business, labour and civil society is also yielding necessary interventions to positioning South Africa as an attractive investment destination while also creating an enabling policy environment for inclusive economic growth. The rating action by Moody’s demonstrates that South Africans working together can achieve remarkable outcomes.”  ANN7 Reporter
