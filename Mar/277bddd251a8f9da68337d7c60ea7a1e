Gauteng Finance MEC Barbra Creecy says tough economic times will mean that more residents of the province than ever before are going to be dependent on government services. Creecy was speaking while delivering the 2018 Budget speech where she detailed the provincial government’s poverty alleviation programmes. The Gauteng government announced that it has allocated R4.9 billion to the Department of Social Development for the 2018 budget of which R293 million for services for the provinces aged. “R2.3 billion will be spent towards services for children, of which R280 million is to fund new Early Childhood Development Centres with toys, libraries and playgroups, minor renovations including ablution facilities, standardized meals for children in the poorest wards and capacity building,” she said. Meanwhile, Creecy said that while Gauteng remains the largest provincial economy in the country, growth has been hard hit by low investment and confidence. The Gauteng Provincial Government tabled a budget of R135 billion which increased from R121 billion the previous year. The MEC said during times of rising direct and indirect taxes, the province’s citizens have a right to know that their taxes are put to the best possible use. “Provincial Treasury remains committed to cutting waste and improving financial management, so we ensure that the money we have is used to put human well-being above everything else.” Meanwhile, the Finance MEC also announced that the Department of Roads and Transport whose budget increases by R700 million to R6.4 billion will begin planning the provinces first new highway since the 1970s, namely the PWV 15. “The Gauteng Government’s R42.2 billion infrastructure spend has made a major contribution to stimulating economic activity, creating employment and raising living standards in communities across our province over the last four years,” she said. -TNA Reporter
