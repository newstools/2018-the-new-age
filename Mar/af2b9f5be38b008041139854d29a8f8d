Three more suspects believed to be involved in the kidnapping of a 13-year-old girl and 15-month-old baby boy in Vosman, Mpumalanga, appeared at the Witbank Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. The trio, Thulani Thobela, 26, Donie Cavin Boshielo, 22 and Mthobisi Brilliant Mkhize, 26, were arrested in Vosman on Wednesday after a manhunt by the police. The men reportedly broke into the children’s home in Hlalanikahle on 20 January and kidnapped them. Thirteen-year-old Gabisile Shabani’s body was found buried in a shallow grave in Cullinan. Her head and some of her body parts were missing. Meanwhile, the body of 15-month-old Nkosikhona Ngwenya was found near the N4 Highway outside Emalahleni after he was “mistakenly” kidnapped from his home by armed robbers who allegedly wanted his albino cousin of the same age. The first suspect, Thokozani Msibi, 32, appeared at the Witbank Magistrate’s Court where his case was postponed to 6 March. The four men are facing charges of murder and two counts of kidnapping. -TNA Reporter
