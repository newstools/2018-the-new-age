At least 23 protesters are due to appear at the Kabokweni Magistrate’s Court for a formal bail application following public violence that erupted in the Masoyi area, Mpumalanga. It is reported that the protesters were arrested for conducting a service delivery protest that initially began on Monday. The protest turned violent when several businesses owned by foreign nationals were looted and the R538 road that leads to Kruger National Park’s Numbi Gate was closed. Provincial Commissioner of the South African Police Service in Mpumalanga, Lieutenant General Mondli Zuma condemned the unruly behaviour by some community members. “It is of great concern that to this day we still deal with violent protesters in our communities, we understand the need to voice out public concerns but being violent and disrupting the rights of others is a crime that will not go unpunished,” Zuma said. -TNA Reporter
