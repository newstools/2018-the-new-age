The University of Johannesburg will acknowledge the fourth Chief Justice of South Africa Mogoeng Thomas Reetsang Mogoeng with an honorary doctoral degree on Tuesday. The UJ Executive Dean of the Law Faculty Prof Letlhokwa George Mpedi said that Judge Mogoeng’s commitment to serving humankind by upholding the independence of the judiciary and by promoting access to justice in tangible ways has earned him widespread respect and admiration. “Through his actions, Judge Mogoeng has been concretising the core the University’s values. An unquestionable ethical foundation is evident from his judgments in the Constitutional Court, delivered without fear or favour, as well as from his public addresses and publications. “Mogoeng has earned trust and credibility through judgments of executive decisions and conduct, parliamentary rules and conventions and legislation that does not conform to the Constitution, also resisting political pressure and maintaining judicial independence.” Mogoeng assumed his office as Chief Justice in September 2011. Under his leadership of the judicial branch of government, there has been an advancement of the constitutional values of human dignity and equality. Mpedi said Mogoeng’s commitment to judicial independence has a wider purpose, promoting access to justice by regenerating the judicial system. “His quest for institutional legitimacy of the judiciary is rooted in the realisation that many South Africans felt alienated from the court system.” -TNA Reporter
