Afrikaans rights organisation AfriForum said it will oppose the court application by the Nelson Mandela Foundation’s to have the old South African flag declared hate speech and banned, after being added as a respondent. The foundation approached the equality court seeking to declare the displaying of the apartheid-era flag constituted hate speech, unfair discrimination and harassment based on race. AfriForum deputy CEO Ernst Roets said despite the organisation not using the old flag, it will oppose the application on the basis of healthy legal principles and a plea for consistency. “The NMF argues that the flag is offensive and should, therefore, be banned. Offensiveness is not a sufficient reason to have a symbol banned, however. In fact, the core of freedom of speech is seated in people sometimes being confronted with offensive viewpoints,” Roets said. He said AfriForum believes that the NMF’s arguments could also lead to the banning of the ANC or SACP’s flags as communists leaders like Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong who are honoured as heroes by ANC loyalists waged murder campaigns against their opponents. “It is estimated that 100 million people from all over the world died in the name of communism. Even in South Africa, more people were killed in the name of communism and the ANC and SACP’s people’s war against rival black organisations, compared to the number of people killed in the name of apartheid.” “For every person killed by the government of the day during apartheid, about 30 people died in the name of the people’s war,” Roets said. He said the exact arguments being made by the foundation to argue why the old flag should be banned could, therefore, be used to ban the SACP or even the ANC’s flag, which is not the correct way to react to offensiveness. -TNA Reporter
