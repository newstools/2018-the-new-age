The Free State Democratic Alliance (DA) says time is running out for Premier Ace Magashule to vacate his office. The DA in the province has previously called for the premier to leave office because of corruption allegations levelled against him. The alleged corruption is in relation to the controversial Estina dairy farm project in Vrede where the province is alleged to have channeled about R220-million during his tenure. The money is alleged to have been channeled to benefit the Gupta family. The DA then made submissions for a motion of no confidence against Magashule. “It remains the prerogative of the ANC’s National Executive Committee (NEC) to appoint the new Premier. The NEC has very few choices who are not tainted by some form of a corruption scandal in the Free State,” the party said. Magashule was elected as ANC secretary-general in December last year and is expected to forfeit the premier position. However, the DA says that “the choices for a replacement for Premier of the Free State are very restricted.” The party alleges that none of the frontrunners to replace the premier are up to the task. According to the DA, a front-runner for the premier’s position, Mmathabo Leeto, who is the MEC for Sports, Arts, and Culture is alleged to be compromised by criminal charges against her. -TNA Reporter
