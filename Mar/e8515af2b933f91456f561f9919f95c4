South Africans have decided to raise funds for triathlete Mhlengi Gwala, for his medical bills, after he was attacked by three men in Durban on Tuesday. Gwala was reportedly accosted by three armed men with a saw before they dragged him into the bushes and attempted to cut off both his legs. JP Valverde started a campaign to raise R100 000 to pay for the medical bills, as  Gwala focuses on recovering. “We are hoping to raise funds to support him with all his medical expenses, transportation, bike replacement and rehabilitation costs,” Valverde said. “We want to see him back on his bike!” -TNA Reporter
