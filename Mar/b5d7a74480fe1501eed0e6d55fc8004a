I am happy to announce that provided we continue consuming water at current levels and we receive decent winter rainfall this year, Day Zero will not occur in 2018, DA leader Mmusi Maimane said. He said water consumption currently sits between 510 and 520 million litres per day. Following the worst drought the city has reportedly seen in over 100 years and its water supply near depletion, he said it was important for him to intervene and ensure that residents receive the level of service and honest government that they expect from the DA. “I, therefore, decided to take political control of the situation and appoint a Drought Crisis Team, made up of the individuals who are committed to doing everything possible to fight this water crisis on all fronts.” The city’s consumption has reduced with 60% and the party is pleased with the achievement, saying it has outperformed many other cities across the world which faced severe droughts. Maimane extended his gratitude to the private water transfer which has helped to defeat Day Zero in 2018. “I am satisfied with the good work done by Deputy Mayor Neilson, MMC Limberg, Premier Zille and Minister Bredell, and would like to thank them and their departments in both local and provincial government for the crucial role played in tackling this crisis. I have full faith in their ability to see us through this water crisis.” He said while we must celebrate our collective achievement, this is not the time for complacency. “While it is now unlikely to occur in 2018, Day Zero is still a very real possibility during the 2019 summer months if we do not have significant rainfall this winter.” -TNA Reporter
