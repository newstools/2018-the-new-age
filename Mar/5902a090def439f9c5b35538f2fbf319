Imagine Queen Elizabeth being harassed by Scotland Immigration. Africans are a joke #Lesotho — African (@ali_naka) March 28, 2018 We don’t want Minister Sisulu to set her foot in here after Easter. The delay of “after Easter” is already ANNOYING. Ramaphosa should come and apologise for this. Why delagate a mere minister? Basotho RESPECT and VALUE their King.
