Mokoena’s body was discovered last month following a brief manhunt after she went missing. Her brutal murder led to an outpouring of messages condemning the abuse of a woman. Mantsoe is facing charges of premeditated murder, assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm and defeating the ends of justice. The matter has also been moved from the magistrate’s court to the high court. In his bail application, the court heard it was possible that Mokoena was alive when Mantsoe doused her with petrol and acid before setting her alight. Mantsoe, who was denied bail in June by the Johannesburg Central Magistrate’s Court, is in police custody. #SandileMantsoe will remain in custody @ANN7tv . — Canny Maphanga (@CannyMaphanga) March 19, 2018 Read: Karabo Mokoena’s alleged killer charged with murder and defeating ends of Justice -TNA Reporter
