The Sunnyside police have announced that a combined 24-hour Operation Fiela has resulted in the recovery of two firearms, 15 live rounds and the imprisonment of three suspects in possession of both unlicensed firearms and a suspected hijacked motor vehicle. The operation commenced on Wednesday after a multifaceted parade was addressed and inspired by the Executive Mayor of Tshwane Msimanga. Police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said local high school learners must be commended for alerting the police about a suspicious 32-year-old man who was spotted hanging around next to the school. “Following a swift response, the police recovered a firearm and ammunition upon the suspect’s arrest.” Meanwhile later the same day, two 21-year-old men were reportedly found in possession of a hijacked Toyota Hi-Lux. The duo reportedly hijacked the vehicle from a police officer in Pretoria West. Mavimbela said the suspects were allegedly also found with unlicensed firearms and ammunition. “The police also seized 2.5million millilitres of alcohol from a local nightclub operating without a license.” Mavimbela added that all suspects are expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court as soon as they are officially charged. All the suspects who were arrested during the past 24 hours are expected to be charged for various offences. “The past twenty-four hours should serve as a warning shot to criminals. The local police will work with other law enforcement agencies like the TMPD to ensure that not only are our people safe, but feel safe during the long Easter Weekend.” -TNA Reporter
