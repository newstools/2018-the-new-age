Forum 4 Service Delivery Youth Movement (F4SDY) has on Saturday condemned the series of burglaries at schools in the Gauteng Province. The forum said the recent robberies raise a serious security risk towards the safety of learners and schools property adding that the matter warranted immediate mechanisms to be introduced to combat the continuous looting in schools. “F4SDY is utterly gobsmacked by this hideous act as its main intention is to deprive our learners of their right to a better and well-resourced education. This is a security risk towards the safety of all our learners and schools property and warrants for immediate mechanisms to be introduced to combat the continuous looting in all our transformed schools.” This comes after an Atteridgeville school Dr. WF Nkomo High experienced the second robbery this week. On Monday the school was robbed of newly installed smart boards. At the time, the departmental spokesperson Steve Mabona said MEC Panyaza Lesufi was devastated by the news, saying that it looked like the school was under siege. Meanwhile, the F4SDY urged communities to be in the guard of the schools in their surrounding areas as they are the sole benefactors of these schools. “As a vanguard of our marginalized communities and learners: F4SDY calls for a working relationship with the MEC Of Education in Gauteng: Mr. Panza Lesufi. “We have again drafted a clear program that will make sure that learners return the educational gadgets that are given to them. The program will make means that learners use those gadgets for educational purposes other than anything else.” -TNA Reporter
