The three Gupta brothers will not be appearing before Parliament’s public enterprises committee on Tuesday, as expected. The Gupta family lawyer sent a letter to Parliament on Monday, informing the committee that the family is out of the country. The Guptas were expected to be questioned over state capture allegations involving Eskom contracts and the controversial Estina Dairy Farm Project. Ajay Gupta has since been declared a fugitive, despite no formal charges being laid against him. Duduzane Zuma and former South African Airways chairperson Dudu Myeni will also not appear before the inquiry. Myeni said she was too sick to attend while committee Chairperson Zukiswa Rantho said she received a letter from Zuma’s lawyers. “Duduzane will is also not be coming to the committee. His lawyers have sent a letter that says he will not be able to come to the committee,” Rantho said. “The Guptas brothers are also not coming to the committee because they are out of the country, so they will not come.” -TNA Reporter
