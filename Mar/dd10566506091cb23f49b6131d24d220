Sanco has on Saturday condemned reckless driving and mob justice in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal. This comes after a driver was stabbed to death on Friday night for slamming into a group of pedestrians and killing six victims at Taylors Halt. ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak reported that the six pedestrians died on the scene, while the driver was also found with fatal injuries. “It is understood from bystanders that members of the community allegedly stabbed the driver to death shortly after the accident,” Vermaak said. Sanco National spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu said that this barbaric and horrendous acts that undermine the rule of law will only lead to lawlessness and a vicious cycle of violence. “We urge communities to report crimes to authorities in the criminal justice system instead of taking the law into their own hands.” Mahlangu appealed to motorists to drive with extreme caution in order to reduce the carnage on public roads. “Road safety is the responsibility of all road users.” -TNA Reporter
