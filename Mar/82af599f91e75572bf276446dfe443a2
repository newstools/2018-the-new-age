THE Directorate For Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) will continue with its criminal investigation against former chief officer Jonas Makwakwa for alleged corruption, money laundering and racketeering. This is according to SARS commissioner Tom Monyane as he announced the resignation of Makwakwa on Wednesday afternoon. “Allegations of impropriety against Mr Makwakwa in respect of the selection and appointment of New intergrated credit solutions, a debt collection agency,” Monyane said. Civil Society organisation Corruption Watch yesterday said they were still gunning for the heads of SARS commissioner Monyane along with that of Makwakwa who resigned from his post on Wednesday. “Makwakwa’s resignation means that this now falls away in terms of litigation. However, given Moyane’s violations of Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act and Financial Intelligence Centre Act , Makwakwa and Kelly-Ann Elskie in respect of the FICA offences, confirmation from the Hawks that the NPA is not proceeding with the prosecution of Moyane, Corruption Watch has written to the NPA asking for reasons for their decision and for a certificate nolle prosequi to be issued,” Corruption Watch said. They said this certificate will enable the organisation to mount a private criminal prosecution for the FICA and PRECCA violations of Monyane, Makwkwa and Elskie. Corruption Watch had laid charges on both men and Elskie in 2016 for alleged fraud and corruption. “The charges highlighted apparent breaches of Section 34 of the PRECCA and sections of the FICA,” Corruption Watch said. They said the reinstatement of Makwakwa last year following an investigation by international law firm Hogan Lovells and a later disciplinary hearing that found him not guilty, does not alter the premise of these charges. At first the civil society organisation wanted the reinstatement of Makwakwa be set aside as it was based on the Hogan Lovells report. hlonim@thenewage.co.za
