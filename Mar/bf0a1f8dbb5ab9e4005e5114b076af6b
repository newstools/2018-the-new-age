Buffalo Bills wide receiver Zay Jones was being held at USC Medical Center on Tuesday after an arrest the previous night on suspicion of felony vandalism in Los Angeles. TMZ posted a video that purportedly showed a naked Isaiah “Zay” Jones struggling with his brother, Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Cayleb Jones, in the hallway of a building. The clothed man is trying to control the naked man, who is heard saying, “I’m going to fight for Jesus.” Broken windows and blood-covered walls are subsequently seen in the video. A Los Angeles Police Department spokesperson said, “Central division responded around 11:20 Monday to Isaiah Jones, described as a suspect breaking glass doors & windows. When officers responded, he was placed under arrest & booked for felony vandalism. He’s being held at USC Medical Center” The Bills released a statement that read, “We are aware of the incident involving Zay Jones. We are still in the process of gathering more information on the matter. At this point, we will have no further comment.” Zay Jones, 22, was a second-round pick by Buffalo out of East Carolina last year. He produced 27 catches for 316 yards and two touchdowns as a rookie. Cayleb Jones, 24, played college ball for Texas and Arizona. He failed to make the Philadelphia Eagles’ roster as an undrafted free agent in 2016, then joined the Minnesota Vikings’ practice squad in December 2016. He spent all of the 2017 seasons on Minnesota’s practice squad and signed a futures contract with the Vikings earlier this year. -Reuters
