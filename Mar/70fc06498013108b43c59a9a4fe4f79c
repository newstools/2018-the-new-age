German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday strongly criticised the Turkish military offensive against Kurdish militants in their Syrian stronghold of Afrin. “Despite all the legitimate security interests Turkey has, it is unacceptable what is happening in Afrin, where thousands and thousands of civilians are being persecuted, dying or forced to flee,” she told parliament. “We also condemn that in the strongest terms.” -AFP
