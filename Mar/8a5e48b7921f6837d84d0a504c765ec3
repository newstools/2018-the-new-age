Former Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has resigned as a Member of Parliament on Friday. Mbalula is now African National Congress (ANC) head of campaign at the party’s headquarters in Johannesburg. Former ANC Youth League President was sacked as Police Minister by Current ANC President and head of state Cyril Ramaphosa last month. ANC parliamentary caucus confirmed that Mbalula has indeed resigned as an MP. “The Office of the ANC Chief Whip confirms that former Minister of Police, comrade Fikile Mbalula, tendered his resignation as an ANC Member of Parliament in the National Assembly effective from 26 February 2018. “While comrade Mbalula’s departure from Parliament will leave a void, we derive satisfaction from the knowledge that he will continue serving the movement as the ANC’s Head of Elections towards the 2019 General Elections campaign,” the party said in a statement. He is the second Member of Parliament to resign after the reshuffle. -TNA Reporter
