NUMSA spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola has labelled “pure propaganda” the announcement by the Department of Energy that there was no court interdict to stop the signing off of 27 independent renewable power projects. She said the department was humiliated “and they are trying to spin what was an embarrassing court judgment against them”. She said the court had asked the Department of Energy to submit answering affidavits so that the full matter could be heard on March 27. She said that by Eskom’s own admission, job losses would be in the region of 30000-40000 and power stations in Mpumalanga will be closed. “All of the industries that are Eskomdependent will also suffer,” HlubiMajola said. She said the power utility also admitted that the implementation of these projects would be very costly, more than the 77c it is allowed to charge per kilowatt. “Now the question is who is going to pay the difference of the cost that is charged by IPPs and Eskom? Who is going to make up that difference?” Hlubi-Majola said. She said key to the problem was a lack of consultation with various stakeholders and that very serious questions hadn’t been answered. These questions are related to cost, implementation and jobs. “Numsa’s reason for getting involved was purely because we felt that we have to protect the rights of the working class majority who will be affected by this decision,” she said. She said that Numsa had tried to have discussions with the minister and Eskom but there had been no engagement. –HLONI MASHIGO|hlonim@thenewage.co.za
