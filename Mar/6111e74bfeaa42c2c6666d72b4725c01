Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has requested for his appearance before the parliamentary inquiry into state capture to be extended. Gigaba was scheduled to appear before the Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises to account for governance failures, mismanagement of state funds at state-owned enterprises and disapproved appointments of executives. He is alleged to have irregularly facilitated the issuing of contracts to Gupta-related companies while he was still the Public Enterprise’s Minister between 2010 and 2014. Inquiry Chairperson Zukiswa Rantho said that the Minister wrote to the committee to request for an extension. “I decided to send the letter to the members of the committee to inform them about the Minister’s request instead of waiting until Tuesday for the scheduled meeting. The committee will deliberate and discuss the Minister’s request at its next scheduled meeting.” The chairperson said that as a result of the minister’s letter, the committee meeting has been cancelled. This comes after another high ranking government official avoided to appear before parliament. Former South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson Dudu Myeni last week canceled her appearance on her inquiry. She sent her apology to the committee through an SMS. -TNA Reporter
