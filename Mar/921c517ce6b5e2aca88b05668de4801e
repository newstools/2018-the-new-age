WHILE the victim of a previous protest in KwaDukuza is fighting for her life, another two people were hospitalised following more violent protests in the area in the early hours of yesterday morning. A power outage in Groutville was reportedly the reason behind the violent protest that led to the barricading of the N2 and the R102 roads. Protesters blocked the roads with burning tyres and debris before stoning passing vehicles. A motorist who was caught up in the protest allegedly shot at the protesters, injuring two people. Police spokesperson Col Thembeka Mbhele said two counts of attempted murder were being investigated by KwaDukuza SAPS. “It is alleged that at the Groutville market offramp, the suspect who was travelling in a VW Golf 7 opened fire in people who were at the market. They sustained injuries and were taken to hospital for medical attention. Investigations are still continuing and no arrest has been made at this stage,” Mbhele said. The raging protests which lasted until yesterday afternoon have been condemned by the KwaDukuza municipality which noted that this was not the first protest over electricity that had ended with a person being hospitalised. The first victim, Sashnee Daniel‚ 27, was seriously injured in early March when a brick was hurled through her car window as she drove past protesters along the R102. Municipal spokesperson Sipho Mkhize confirmed that the protests were fuelled by power outages linked to the municipality’s decision to cut down on overtime pay. “It is very unfortunate that these protests have caused harm to properties and individuals. We wish to put it on record that the municipality’s electrical engineering business unit is hard at work to fix all issues currently barring some households from getting electricity,” Mkhize said. The affected areas include Mathenjwa, Ntshawini, Groutville, Shakaville and Thembeni. –SIBONGISENI MAPHUMULO|sibongisenim@thenewage.co.za
