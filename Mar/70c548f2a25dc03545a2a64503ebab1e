Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has vowed to press on with plans to bring white South African farmers to that country and to make the process of moving there more simple for them. Dutton was speaking in reaction to a storm of controversy that followed his announcement that the Australian government would look into speeding up the farmers’ applications to move to the more “civilised country,” as they were being persecuted in South Africa. South African Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Lindiwe Sisulu issued a scathing statement, calling on Dutton to immediately retract his statements as they were misleading, alarming and harmful to South Africa’s image. Speaking during an interview on commercial radio station 2GB commercial on Wednesday, Dutton said he was unfased by the criticism that has been leveled against him and being accused of being a racist. “All the criticism over the last week has meant nothing to me. It concerns me that people are being persecuted at the moment… that’s the reality… the numbers of people dying or being savagely attacked in South Africa is a reality. We’re looking at ways we can help people to migrate to Australia if they’re finding themselves in that situation,” Dutton said. Dutton said he has received a lot of positive messages of support since he made his views on South Africa known. “If people think I’m going to cower or take a backward step because of their nonsense, fabricated, fake news criticism, then they’ve got another thing coming.” -TNA Reporter
