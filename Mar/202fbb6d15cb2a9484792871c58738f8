The DA on Sunday said it would write to newly appointed Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene to ask him to urgently obtain a report on the procurement deviation requested by the SAA CEO to source additional loans of R15 billion. The party was responding to media reports that the company plans to request a deviation from normal procurement guidelines. The DA’s shadow finance minister Alf Lees said the motivation for these funds apparently included hiring consultants to provide “cultural change services”. Lees said after four months in the job SAA CEO Vuyani Jarana had made it clear that the new culture was one of honesty, integrity, efficiency and hard work. “The R10 billion taxpayer bailout of SAA was never going to be enough to keep the mismanaged, corruption-ridden, over-staffed and inefficient state-owned airline in the air. Even the so-called turn-around plan under the new board and CEO Vuyani Jarana shows losses continuing until 2020,” Lees said. According to Lees, SAA has used up most of the R19.1 billion in government guarantees and there can be no further guarantees issued to a bankrupt and loss-making company. He said Nene must now take the bold step to place SAA under business rescue with a clear undertaking that the airline will be privatised within the 2018-19 financial year. “The DA will ensure that this is interrogated further when we put tough questions to SAA representatives who will be appearing before Parliament’s standing committee on finance on 20 March.” “Instead of wasting another R4.7 billion on a further bailout that is apparently planned in 2018-19, these funds must be used to balance the 2018 budget instead of increasing VAT by 1%, an increase that will make it even more difficult for the poor and unemployed 9.2 million South Africans.” -TNA Reporter
