The producers of controversial movie Inxeba (The wound) are expected back in the North Gauteng High Court on Wednesday in their bid to overturn the movie’s X18 reclassification. The movie was initially afforded a 16NSL classification. However, the Film and Publication Board (FPB) Appeal Tribunal overturned the classification rating initially given and gave it a rating of X18 with the classifiable elements of Sex, Language, Nudity, Violence and Prejudice. The  X18 rating meant that the material could only be distributed from designated adult premises. This also led to the award-winning film being banned from cinemas in the country. The filmmakers approached the courts last month to overturn that X18 rating. The court temporarily lifted the X-rated ban earlier this month, pending the outcome of the review proceedings. Following this, the film also resumed being screened in cinemas. The film was banned from local cinemas following a series of marches and violent threats which were condemned by the South African Human Rights Commission. The movie recently bagged its 20th accolade during the 12th annual South African Film and Television Awards (Saftas) that were held in Sun City last week. It has won the Golden Horn Award for Best Feature Film. -TNA Reporter
