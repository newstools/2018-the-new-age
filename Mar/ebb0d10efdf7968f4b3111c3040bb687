Newly appointed ANC head of elections Fikile Mbalula on Monday said there was nothing to read about former President Jacob Zuma’s attendance of an ANC elections workshop at the weekend. The party held an elections workshop on Saturday as it prepares for the upcoming 2019 national elections. “The presence of [former] President Jacob Zuma, there is nothing much to read into that except the fact that he is our former president and it will remain like that for many more years to come – that is part of the history,” Mbalula said. He said the former president was approached to attend, and honoured the invitation to “contribute his ideas”. “President Zuma is not a Casanova in a totality of things, the way you may think, because he does have support.” Zuma’s attendance at the elections workshop raised speculation about whether he would participate in the upcoming elections campaign. Mbalula said the face of the ANC campaign was its current President Cyril Ramaphosa and whoever came on to the campaign was an “add-on”. Mbalula said former presidents, including Thabo Mbeki, would be invited for the campaign. He said the ruling party would run a “positive” campaign that was not arrogant and did not undermine its opponents. Given the rise that the opposition has had in the recent elections, including the birth of the EFF, which has gained a lot of support from the youth, Mbalula agreed that the EFF was a political party stamping its authority. “It’s not a question that we are worried or not worried about them, it’s what we do that will determine whether or not we have lost the ground to the youth.” Mbalula said the notion that the ANC was losing on its youth support was not true. -TNA Reporter
