Pressure group Equal Education has approached is seeking to compel Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga to implement minimum norms and standards on infrastructure in schools. Equal Education on Sunday the Education Department has been dragging its feet in addressing infrastructure problems in schools. The NGO approached the High Court following the death of five-year-old Grade R learner Lumka Mketwa who fell into a pit toilet at Luna Junior Primary School and drowned. According to reports, the toilets should have been demolished long ago after it was revealed that they were unsafe. Equal Education said the sympathy expressed by Motshekga is hollow, disrespectful and insensitive to the learner and her family. “Equal Education places the blame for this tragedy on Minister Motshekga, on Basic Education Director General Mathanzima Mweli, on Eastern Cape Education MEC Mandla Makupula, and on Eastern Cape Education Department Head Themba Kojana.” “The provision of safe schools that support learning is not only fundamental to realising the constitutionally guaranteed rights to education, health, equality and human dignity, but is also a life and death question, as shown by the tragic passing of Lumka, and that of Michael Komape in 2014,” he organisation said in a statement. Lumka is not the first learner to drown in a pit toilet. Limpopo learner Michael Komape from Chebeng Village in Limpopo also fell into a pit toilet and drowned at his school in 2014. The High Court in Polokwane is expected to deliver a ruling on a case brought by lobby groups Section 27 and Equal Education. President Cyril Ramaphosa has given Motshekga a month to conduct an audit of all hazardous school structures especially unsafe ablution facilities and come up with a plan to fix them. -TNA Reporter
