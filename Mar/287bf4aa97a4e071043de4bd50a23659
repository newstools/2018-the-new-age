The DA in the Free State on Wednesday said it welcomed the rule of law taking place in the province, which saw a guilty verdict for a businessman. The Bloemfontein High Court found ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule’s business partner Isaac ‘Blackie’ Seoe guilty over an R30 million education tender in which his company was awarded a stake. According to the DA, Seoe failed to disclose his relationship with the then Director-General of the Free State provincial department of education, Tebogo Lioma. It is believed that Lioma’s daughter used to live at one of Seoe’s homes. “Premier Magashule and Mr Seoe were once business partners. In 2011, Sambal Investment, in which both were company directors, secured a government lease deal for the Free State provincial department of sports, arts, and culture at the Business Partners Business Building in the Bloemfontein CBD, to the value of R115 million.” “Tshepiso Magashule, the son of Premier Magashule, had also been a business partner previously,” the DA said in a statement. Seoe is implicated in a 2014 property scandal involving Magashule’s daughter, Thoko Malembe. Earlier in the year, News24 reported that Malembe secured a property deal with the Free State Development Corporation (FDC), which was led by Seoe at the time. The DA said it was encouraged by the long-arm of the law which was slowly but surely closing in around Magashule. -TNA Reporter
