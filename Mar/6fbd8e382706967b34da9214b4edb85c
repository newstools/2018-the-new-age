Three high profile individuals are due to be sentenced for fraud and corruption by the commercial court in Pretoria on Thursday for defrauding millions from the Land Bank. Former Acting CEO of the Land Bank Phillemon Mohlahlane, MP, former chairperson of the Portfolio Committee Manyaba Mohlaloga and Attorney Dinga Nkwashu were convicted of Fraud and Money Laundering. The individuals were arrested by the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation(Hawks) in 2012. In 2008, Mohlahlane, the former Land Bank CEO, is alleged to have conspired with Mohlaloga who was the chairperson of parliament’s portfolio committee on agriculture then and the lawyer to make a transfer of about R6 million from the Land Bank into a law firm account. The Hawks said the money was transferred from Agri-BEE, a broad-based black economic empowerment framework that was intended to support black South Africans to participate in the agricultural sector. “Once the R6 million was transferred to the trust account of no 5 [Masipula Dinga Commercial Attorneys] the money was disbursed by a complicated number of transfers mainly to the benefit of accused Manyaba Mohlaloga and Dinga Nkwashu.” These transfers were done without following proper procedure, while the managers were misled that this was an “urgent ministerial instruction for a ministerial project”. “Their intention was to get access to money destined to assist previously disadvantaged farmers, women, and youth in Agriculture to acquire land and to establish farming enterprises. Our courts should show no mercy to those who lack empathy for the disadvantaged,” Hawks said. NPA Adv. Dries Janse Van Rensburg added that the individuals used their positions of power to ‘blatantly defrauded the Land Bank’. “Our courts should show no mercy to those who lack empathy for the disadvantaged.” -TNA Reporter
