Cosatu in the Western Cape has called on government to deal with racist farmers in the province. The trade union federation on Thursday said, while the province has a number of good farmers, it clearly has many brutally racist farmers and their assaults on farm workers cannot be tolerated in a democratic nation. Provincial Administrator/Gender Coordinator Lumka Tamboer said Cosatu was outraged by the amount of assault incidents that had been taking place on farms over the last few weeks. “We are calling for all the cases of attempted murder to be denied bail and for the abusive farmers to be put in communal cells with criminals,” Tamboer said. The federation has also urged farm workers to put together self defense committees and arm themselves if the police do not defend them. Cosatu will launch a defense fund for farm workers, to bring farmers to the full might of the law for their behaviour. “The Western Cape government is filled with racist, colonial supporting leaders who send a message that this racist behaviour is tolerated and national government must make an urgent intervention to address this conduct.” -TNA Reporter
