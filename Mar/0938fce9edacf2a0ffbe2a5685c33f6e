Cape Town police have launched a manhunt for six offenders who escaped from Pollsmoor Prison. The six allegedly escaped by removing bars from one of the windows at the B section, which is a juvenile section, on Sunday night, by using a piece of metal to move the bars out of place. According to Correctional Services Department spokesperson Simphiwe Xako, one of the escaped inmates was serving a 12-year sentence for attempted murder while the other five were sentenced for petty crimes. “The Department of Correctional Services has initiated an internal investigation into this incident. Members are of the public are urged not to try to engage the six, but rather report to the nearest police station,” Xaba said. Xaba said all escapees are still at large and members of the Correctional Services Emergency Support Team and the SAPS are looking for them. -TNA Reporter
