EFF has welcomed the Constitutional Court’s decision to dismiss an application brought by the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac). The application attempted to delay NPA’s head Shaun Abrahams from announcing on whether former President Jacob Zuma should be prosecuted. Casac had filed an urgent application last week attempting to prevent Abrahams from making the announcement. The EFF says the NPA head must make the pronouncement on Zuma’s fate and subsequent to that, he must vacate his office. “We call on Shaun Abrahams to immediately make the announcement and in same breath step down as the NPA head. The Gauteng North High Court has ruled that his appointment was improper and he should vacate office.” This is in relation to fraud, corruption and racketeering charges against the former president relating to his previous dealings with former financial adviser Schabir Shaik. “Zuma has been asking to have his day in court and he must be given such an opportunity at the earliest convenience,” the EFF said. The former President’s legal matter was under discussion in Parliament on Wednesday following a question from the opposition to President Cyril Ramaphosa. The state has been paying for Zuma’s fees which have since amounted to over R15 million. Ramaphosa announced in Parliament that Zuma had agreed to pay back millions spent on his legal battles if he is found guilty. Meanwhile, the EFF further wants Abrahams to resign before he is legally removed. “Abrahams must do the honourable thing and step down instead of waiting for the Constitutional Court and Ramaphosa to request him to do so. “Nothing will restore confidence in the NPA and the rule of law than Zuma being charged and Abrahams stepping down,” said the EFF. -TNA Reporter
