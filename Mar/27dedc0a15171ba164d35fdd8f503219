Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini has slammed insurance company MiWay for providing no satisfactory explanation as to how a conversation between its salesman and the king was leaked on social media. “MiWay has to date not provided any acceptable explanation as to how that recording was ‘leaked’, which is completely offensive. The nonchalant attitude of MiWay is contrary to good faith in business,” the royal Zulu household said in a statement. This follows a recording that was leaked by MiWay, between King Zwelithini and a salesman. MiWay was criticised for violation of the king’s privacy and for allegedly addressing the king by his first name. An investigation was later initiated by King Zwelithini with MiWay, to understand the circumstances that lead to this “serious transgression”. However, the kingdom said MiWay had not explained itself properly. “The South African consumer and business communities must be aware of the disgraceful and appalling tactics that MiWay uses. MiWay choosing to be decisively silent about explaining itself, is a further act of contempt and indifference. This cannot and will not be accepted.: At the time that the recording was leaked, the Zulu monarch had announced that it was contemplating taking legal action against the company. In a statement, the Zulu monarch said that it would be proceeding with legal action. “His Majesty has instructed his attorney Theisen Pillay to further the interests of the Monarch. His Majesty and the royal household sincerely thank all those that have pledged their support thus far and asks that they further voice their public condemnation of MiWay.” “His Majesty feels that the apology tendered by MiWay was superficial and of no value considering MiWay’s continued avoidance strategy.” -TNA Reporter
