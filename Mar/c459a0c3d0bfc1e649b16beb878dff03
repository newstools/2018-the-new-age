I am convinced that most people at SOEs are good people but there are rotten apples,” the minister said. He further said, SOE board members shouldn’t be involved in the procurement processes, adding that there should not be any conflict of interest between staff and directors. Gordhan said SOE operating models needed to be reviewed on whether they were making enough money to pay for themselves or not. He added that most of the financial problems at SOEs were self-created. Immediately after his appointment, Gordhan said SOEs were a crucial part of South Africa’s economy, adding that the fiscal systems and the extent to which they operate contributed to the development and economic well-being of the country.
