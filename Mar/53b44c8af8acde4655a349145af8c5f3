A 20-year-old man has been arrested for murder following an argument between two learners (aged 14 and 15) at Mbangezike High School in Xikukwani village, Limpopo. It is alleged that after the argument the suspect was called by his brother, 15, who went to the 14-year-old’s home where the suspect stabbed him with a sharp object killing him instantly. “Following the killing, the Xikukwani residents went on a rampage and torched the suspect’s home with everything inside,” Colonel Chris Mabasa said. He added that no one has been arrested in connection with the torching of the house and the suspects responsible for it are still unknown. The suspect will appear before Giyani Magistrate’s Court soon on a charge of murder. -TNA Reporter
