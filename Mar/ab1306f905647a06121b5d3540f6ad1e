The North Gauteng High Court on Tuesday ruled that the movie Inxeba (The Wound) will be screened at cinemas across the country despite a 18X rating by the Film and Publication Board (FPB) pending a review. The court ruled that the movie be allowed to be screened in cinemas in the meantime, until the matter returned to court later this month. The matter will be heard again on 28 March. The FPB had had revised its initial rating on Inxeba (The Wound), which led to the movie being stopped from playing in cinemas. The FPB initially rated Inxeba 16 LS and later revised it to a rating of X18, making it a “porn” movie. The movie was rated X18 for classifiable elements of sex, language, nudity, violence and prejudice it contains. The producers of the movie approached the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria to overturn the rating. The producers filed the application last month. The reclassification of the movie came as a result of complaints from a number of organisations, including one lodged by the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa (Contralesa) in Gauteng. The Publication Board said that the complaints from Contralesa were largely based on the perceived cultural insensitivity and distortion of the Xhosa circumcision tradition and strong language that is contained in the film. -TNA Reporter
