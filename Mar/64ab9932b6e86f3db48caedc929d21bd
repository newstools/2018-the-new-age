The African National Congress (ANC) in KwaZulu-Natal has passed on its condolences to the family of former SABC veteran journalist, Thembuyise “Stu” Ndlovu. Ndlovu, 59, died in the early hours of Tuesday in Durban due to ill health according to an ANC statement. “As an outspoken journalist, Mr Ndlovu brightened many a day with his joyful eloquence reporting on the happenings in our province. He was a permanent feature on our radio, especially Ukhozi FM’s current affairs shows. We are thankful for the role he played as he devoted his life to journalism. “Mr Ndlovu worked tirelessly to ensure that South Africans talk and ultimately understand one another on various issues that form part of our national discourse, especially education. Although we were aware that he struggled with his health, we were not expecting that he will finally succumb to his ailment so early,” KZN Provincial Interim Committee Coordinator, Sihle Zikalala said. Ndlovu retired from the SABC two years ago following a career spanning 20 years which began as a radio newsreader for the then Radio Bantu, which later became Ukhozi FM. As the ANC, we were expecting that Mr Ndlovu was still going to share his journalism knowledge with upcoming journalists to report in a balanced and fair manner in our country. He will be sadly missed,’’ said Zikalala. The ANC has further described Ndlovu’s passing a huge loss to the broadcasting community and the country as a whole. -TNA Reporter
