Deputy Transport Minister Sindisiwe Chikunga has given the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) an April deadline to add more trains to the central line in Cape Town. Chikunga, who inspected the route on Wednesday, found that 33 trains were supposed to run on the central line – but only 10 are operational. “Prasa must get at least three more trains and they can also get some from the Shosholoza Meyl trains,” Chikunga said. The central line recently reopened after services had been suspended for six weeks. The line was suspended following the murder of a Prasa security guard in Khayelitsha, major safety concerns and damaged infrastructure. Over the past two years, Metrorail in Cape Town has reported more than 660 incidents relating to vandalism and attacks. -TNA Reporter
