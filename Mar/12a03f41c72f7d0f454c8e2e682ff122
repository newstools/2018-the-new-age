A tweet under the name Duduzane Zuma which went out on Saturday, in reaction to news that the NPA will reinstate charges against former President Jacob Zuma, has sparked a Twitter conversation on the whereabouts of Duduzane. The twitter account, supposedly that of Duduzane, tweeted: Zuma did what the nation asked and resigned. He does not deserve this treatment, he abonded his family and went to exile to liberate his own people who are today against him. Today I’m referred to as a refugee because of the sacrifices my father did for his people #ZumaCharges — Duduzane Zuma (@Duduzane__Zuma) March 16, 2018 I note that in my previous tweet I mentioned that I was labeled as a “refugee” which was a mistake for “foreigner” I was born in Mozambique, we’ve seen Mr Malema obsess about that. As for a fugitive, I disagree I have done nothing wrong. Doing business with Guptas is not a sin. — Duduzane Zuma (@Duduzane__Zuma) March 17, 2018 Zuma did what the nation asked and resigned.

We will beat drums of hero worship for you — mpush ntabeni (@mpushntabeni) March 19, 2018 Then come back home to clear your name in the court of law. Why are you running away if you have done nothing wrong? you pulled a heist and want us to believe you did nothing? Typical Zuma think you are unaccountable for your actions and always palying a victim — Tonakgolo Pharephare (@kuliwachina) March 18, 2018 Why are you scared to come back to South Africa? — gumede783 (@gumede783) March 18, 2018 Come home boy, how many people benefited on apartheid policies even today they benefiting from it so which race must be rich whites or blacks??? — Bongamahokoto (@Bongamahokoto3) March 18, 2018 -TNA Reporter
