The DA has called for the immediate removal of Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba following the refusal by the Constitutional Court to hear an appeal against a North Gauteng High Court ruling which found that he had committed a breach of the Constitution. The court found that Gigaba lied under oath when he testified on a case brought by Fireblade Aviation during his time as Home Affairs minister, before being shifted to the head the Public Enterprises Department by former President Jacob Zuma. The company wanted to open a private immigration terminal at OR Tambo International Airport, which it claimed Gigaba had granted permission for but later revoked after pressure was allegedly exerted on him by the Gupta family. Gigaba was reappointed as a Home Affairs Minister during President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Cabinet reshuffle. Judge Neil Tuchten, in his ruling, said: “The minister has committed a breach of the Constitution so serious that I could characterise it as a violation.” DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen said it was a little wonder that Gigaba refused to appear in Parliament on Wednesday, on the very same day the judgment was announced, now that he must face the music. “The fact is that he is deeply compromised and cannot be trusted to carry out his constitutional mandate to serve the people of South Africa,” Steenhuisen said. “He is not above lying under oath nor laying the groundwork for the Gupta’s to capture key public institutions for their own selfish gain.” Steenhuisen said, while the DA had laid a formal complaint with Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, asking her to investigate Gigaba for lying under oath and violating the Constitution, the ANC should have no excuse not to act against him if indeed it is a “renewed” organisation. -TNA Reporter
