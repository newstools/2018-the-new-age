Local hit producer Sun-El Musician announced that he just hit the studio with renowned US hip-hop artist and producer DJ Swizz Beatz and pop singer Alicia Keys. The Mooi River-born producer, best known for his smash hit Akanamali alongside Samthing Soweto, took to Instagram to share a picture of himself in the studio with Alicia Keys and her husband in New York. “It still feels a bit unreal, but it happened!” he captioned the post. The singer, real name Sanele Sithole, joins a list of local celebrities who have worked with the Money In The Bank hitmaker such as Black Coffee and Cassper Nyovest. Swizz Beatz is no stranger to South Africa and has made it clear on his social media pages when he visited the country last month that he can’t get enough of the South African art culture. During his recent visit, the award-winning entertainer performed at a Johannesburg concert bought artwork in the form of Ndebele-inspired rugs from Esther Mahlangu and even shared a video on his Instagram account in February of his son Genesis dancing along to Akanamali. The move led to Samthing Soweto expressing his wish to record with the US husband and wife duo on Twitter, saying: “My team and @sunelmusician are in New York City! We working with the best. I’m not there yet but soon I’ll be able to say I worked with @therealswizzz and @aliciakeys.” – Nontokozo Ngxumisa
