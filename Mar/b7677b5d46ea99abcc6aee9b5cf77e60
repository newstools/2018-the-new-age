The South African Football Association (Safa) arbitration has ordered that Ajax Cape Town striker Tendai Ndoro immediately stop playing for his team. The player was ordered to immediately stop playing while his matter gets referred to the International footballers association (FIFA). This comes after the local soccer body, Premier Soccer League (PSL) lodged a complaint against a ruling that declared Ndoro eligible to play, which was handed by the leagues  Dispute Resolution Chambers. In a statement, Safa said that the matter was referred to FIFA as the local Dispute Resolution Chamber has no jurisdiction on the matter. “Arbitrator Nassir Cassim SC has ruled that the Tendai Ndoro matter be referred to the world football governing body, FIFA arguing the PSL’s Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) does not have jurisdiction over the matter,” Safa said in a statement. The player contravened FIFA’s Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players by playing for Orlando Pirates, Saudi Arabian club Al Faisaly and Ajax Cape Town in a single season. “FIFA rules prohibit a player to play for three different clubs in a single season.” Orlando Pirates FC and Polokwane City FC had lodged a protest with the PSL arguing that Ajax Cape Town had contravened FIFA rules by fielding the player. The case was referred to FIFA because the matter involved an international club. -TNA Reporter
