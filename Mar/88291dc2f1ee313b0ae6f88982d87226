The Gauteng Department of Education has called on the School Governing Body (SGB) and principal to act without favour against learners depicted fighting on a video. This comes after a video surfaced on social media showing learners from Eldorado Park Secondary, in the south of Johannesburg, fighting in a classroom. Gauteng Department of Education’s Spokesperson Steve Mabona said that the behaviour is unacceptable and all those involved should face disciplinary action. “The department has a policy of zero-tolerance against bullying or any form of misconduct. In this respect, the GDE calls on the SGB and the Principal to enforce the school’s Code of Conduct,” said Mabona. It is believed that the fight that happened occurred during the time when some educators had withdrawn labour and reporting at the District. This recent incident comes just days after a learner from Three Rivers school in the Vaal threw a book at the teacher. -TNA Reporter
