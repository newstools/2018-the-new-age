The police on Tuesday warned Sunnyside residents to be careful of crime syndicates posing as both police officers and “prophets”. This follows a number of complaints received by the police from college and university students in the area who have been robbed off their money, cellphones, laptops and jewelry. Police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said the suspects have been approaching victims with stories that lead them to believe that they could be in imminent danger. “Though the general public is not immune against the activities of the same syndicate recently, students have been the sole targeted group,” Mavimbela said. The latest incident involves a 19-year old student who was told that the money he had saved at his residence could be “blood money”. The victim reportedly boarded the suspects’ car to his residence, where he handed over R3 600 for “inspection and cleansing”. When the suspects gave back the envelope of money after the “cleansing”, it contained papers. “Reports suggest that the type of stories that are shared with potential victims, change from time to time.” The police have advised members of the community to reject any form of help, blessings or prayers offered by unknown people who claim to know of their misfortunes. “Communities are further encouraged to report suspicious persons, vehicles and those responsible for illegal activities.” -TNA Reporter
