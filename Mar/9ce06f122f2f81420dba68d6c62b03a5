The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa)  has criticised Eskom for its inability to efficiently collect revenue, as a result, causing it to apply for exorbitant tariff increases. The power regulator said this led to Eskom having more power interruptions at the municipalities that are defaulting on their payments. Nersa announced during a briefing to Parliament’s portfolio committee on Energy on Tuesday that the tariff increase request by Eskom did not give enough consideration to already burdened consumers, who are placed under pressure by the stagnant economy and depressed economic environment. “Continued increases in tariffs have seen commensurate decreases in consumption, which have been attributed to, among others, affordability limits having been reached by customers.” Nersa told the committee that it had advised Eskom about the difference between the actual sale and price of electricity and that it had become an unsustainable debt trap, which threatened both Eskom and the South African economy. As such, Nersa told Eskom to reduce its expenditure while improving revenue collection. New electricity prices will be implemented from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019, for non-municipal customers and from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019 for municipal customers. Nersa also informed the committee that Eskom had requested a 19% tariff increase and might, therefore, take the decision on review. -TNA Reporter
