The Univen management has expressed their disappointment over the behaviour of the protesting students who have engaged in violence and destructive action over the last three days. This followed Univen students’ protest against delayed food and books allowance by NSFAS. The University’s spokesperson Takalani Dzaga said the students’ actions has caused damage not only on the municipal and campus infrastructure but also the university’s reputation. “Management is concerned that the forced closure of our Campus has disrupted the academic programme, which includes not only teaching and learning but also some world-class research undertaken in our science laboratories,” Dzaga said. He said that management is committed to working with the student leadership to address the legitimate concerns raise on behalf of the Univen student body in an atmosphere of mutual respect, trust and accountability. “Such actions of violence, destructive protest, and interruptions of the academic programme are unnecessary and will not be condoned.” “We are happy to announce that management was able to work extensively over the last couple of days with NSFAS to ensure that all qualifying students are paid their outstanding allowances.” -TNA Reporter
