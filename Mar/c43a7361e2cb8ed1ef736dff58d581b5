Walter Sisulu University has decided to close the Nelson Mandela Drive Campus in Mthatha following rampages and damage to the university’s property. The management of the university is also considering closing the Butterworth and Buffalo City campuses as a result of a protest by students at both campuses. Students at the Mthatha Campus are complaining about the online allocation of student accommodation. Security officers were injured when they were removed from campus after starting their own protest at the Mthatha campus demanding that their dismissed colleagues be reemployed by the university. According to University spokesperson Yonela Tukwayo, a security car was on Wednesday burned at the Mthatha campus. Tukwayo told regional Newspaper Daily Dispatch that this left the vice-chancellor with no choice but to halt all administrative and academic activities in order to protect university assets. She said students at the Butterworth campus resolved to shut down the campus after raising their unhappiness with accommodation and infrastructure development. “Students and staff have been requested to leave the WSU campuses whilst management are busy holding meetings to see how they can negotiate a peaceful reopening,” Tukwayo told Daily Dispatch. -TNA Reporter
