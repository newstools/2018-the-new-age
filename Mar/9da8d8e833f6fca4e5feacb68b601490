The DA wants former SABC boss Hlaudi Motsoeneng to pay back an amount of R22 million allegedly used to finance his legal costs while he was still Chief Operating Officer at the national broadcaster. The amount was revealed to the DA in a reply from former Communications Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane,who revealed that the public broadcaster had paid the millions of rands in legal fees for Motsoeneng since 2013. The amount stems from legal fees that include the actions that were taken by SABC News anchor Vuyo Mvoko, which amounted to R1 186 184. Another case by former SABC head of news Verona Duwarkah costed the SABC, R505 985. Other cases taken concerning various board matters further taxed the SABC R4 990 985. “This R22 million by far exceeds the R15 million taxpayers have had to fork out on former President Jacob Zuma’s legal fees. Just like the other litigious delinquent, Jacob Zuma, Motsoeneng must pay this money back to the public purse, the DA said in a statement. Motsoeneng was dismissed from the SABC after being found guilty of contravening the corporation’s code of conduct. This was after Motsoeneng called a press conference in which he allegedly criticised the SABC’s interim board. Motsoeneng is currently fighting for his reinstatement at the SABC. Meanwhile, in evidence given by the SABC’s deputy chairwoman Khanyisile Kweyama during CCMA’s arbitration process on Wednesday, Motsoeneng does not qualify to hold the position of chief operating officer. In addition to this, the DA wants Motsoeneng to pay R43 million after adding the R21 million that the Special Investigating Unit is pursuing as Motseoneng’s debt to the SABC. “The public should not have to pay for this one man wrecking ball’s legal fees.” -TNA Reporter
