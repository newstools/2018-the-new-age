EVERYONE that is working for the organization is doing so lawfully, says Afrotone chairperson Mzwanele Manyi. This was after a surprise visit yesterday by the immigration officials at the company’s offices in Midrand to verify documents for about 18 Indian national journalists who are employed by the company. Manyi said the visit might have been caused by a miscommunication between Afrotone and Home Affairs. He, however, said Home Affairs was within its rights to inspect anybody without giving any notice. “And they have done it twice here,” Manyi. He said Afrotone was going to drop off documents at Home Affairs offices tomorrow to support its stance. “We have nothing to hide as an organisation, somebody might have given them wrong information that we had employed people unlawfully. No one in this organisation is here unlawfully,” he said. Manyi said the company had employees who hold intra-company visas since he purchased the company from a global company,. “The technicality is the issue of what is called intra-company transfers. Oakbay Investments is a global company and that means it could have had employees that have two kinds of work permits to work in South Africa,” Manyi said. The Afrotone chairperson said nobody on the premises had been detained by authroities. “As we speak now all are at their homes. “We have no problem about complying with the law, so we don’t actually see the need for the drama of coming and camping here,” he said. He said his employees were left traumatised by the immigration visits. -TNA Reporter
