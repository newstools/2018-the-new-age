Deputy President David Mabuza on Tuesday said illicit financial flows should be described as organised crime and corruption. Mabuza said this in the National Assembly during his first oral question and answer session. “A problem facing the African continent is the moving of money from one country to another. The duty of Sars is that all companies doing business, whether foreign or domestic, need to be cleared in the form of a tax clearance,” Mabuza said. The deputy president further said that companies which did not meet tax issue standards should not be issued a tax clearance, adding that monies acquired by foreign business will go back to their countries and Sars will then monitors which money left or stayed. He was answering questions from the EFF, who wanted to know what steps government would take to curb the illicit flow of money into the country. Tuesday’s session marked the first time Mabuza appeared before Parliament since he was appointed deputy president by President Cyril Ramaphosa. By virtue of being the deputy president, he also assumes the responsibility of being the leader of government business and the moral regeneration, which among other things includes keeping ministers in line and ensuring that they are accountable. Earlier this month, National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete wrote to Mabuza to deal with ministers who were not appearing in Parliament to answer questions from MPs following the absence of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba and Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Lindiwe Sisulu. Mabuza also reappointed veteran ANC MP and former President Jacob Zuma’s parliamentary councilor Ibrahim Ibrahim. Last week, Ramaphosa also answered questions in Parliament for the first time as president of the country. -TNA Reporter
