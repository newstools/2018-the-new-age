The ANC in the Bokone Bophirima region in the North West on Sunday said, while it welcomed a raid on Premier Supra Mahumapelo’s offices last week, it was worried about the political onslaught. The region said the province and its leadership had been under constant attack from all sites and hoped last week’s raid was not part of it. The region was responding to last week’s raid at Mahumapelo’s office by the Hawks over the investigation of several tenders and allegations of corruption. “Over a period of time, we have been observing worrisome signals of a total
political onslaught in the province and we hope that this development does
not constitute part of this observation,” ANC Bokone Bophirima acting provincial secretary Susanna Dantjie said. Dantjie said they welcomed the raids on Mahumapelo’s office. as this was in line with the ANC’s resolution, which was taken during the 54th Elective Conference in December. “We welcome the initiative by the premier to implement resolutions of the ANC’s 54th National Conference of eradicating greed, crime and corruption.” Meanwhile, the portfolio committee on health and social development has laid charges of corruption against Mahumapelo, finance and enterprise MEC Wendy Nelson and health HOD Thabo Lekalakala following allegations of mismanagement of public funds. The committee said it had found evidence that the three senior officials were implicated in illegal dealings, some of which are linked to the Gupta family. -TNA Reporter
