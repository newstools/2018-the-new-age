Former President Jacob Zuma’s attorneys have announced that they are considering to review the decision by the NPA to prosecute him. This followed the announcement made by the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NNPP) Shaun Abrahams to prosecute Zuma on 16 charges. The former president’s attorney Michael Hurlley said they are giving consideration to the one page and somewhat terse response received from Abrahams, where he advised that the representations made on behalf of Zuma are unsuccessful. “The rationale for this decision is not clearly apparent from the communication, nor is the bases for the refusal,” Hurlley said. In this circumstances, he added that the likely course of action would be to take the decision of the NDPP on review. “This decision will however only be made after a careful consideration and consultation with Zuma.” -TNA Reporter
