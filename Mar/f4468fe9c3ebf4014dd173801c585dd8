Numsa members have downed tools at Abengoa South Africa in the Northern Cape. Numsa claims the workers at the renewable energy plants do not get any benefits. “They are denied medical aid, a housing allowance, a provident fund and other benefits,” Numsa General-Secretary Irvin Jim said on Sunday. “Their wages are spent on covering all these expenses. This is why the entire workforce is on strike, to demand higher wages and benefits. The energy minister claimed that these firms would bring ‘entrepreneurial opportunities’ in our rural communities”. “Our members can confirm that this is hogwash. There is very little development and certainly no opportunities for entrepreneurship in the surrounding area of the firm.” Numsa said it is not opposing renewable energy. “We are one of the very few trade unions which have several resolutions on renewable energy. We believe that we must stop depending on fossil fuels because of the negative impact on the environment and the health implications for working class families.” “We are calling for a just transition to renewable energy. We demand that the state adhere to the guidelines of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which they agreed to when they signed the Paris Accord.” Meanwhile, Numsa said the IPP would result in job losses. “Eskom has confirmed that when the IPP contracts are signed, five Eskom power plants in Mpumalanga would be put on ‘cold reserve’. This is a kind way of saying there will be job losses. They will cut hours which will drastically reduce pay, and eventually they will retrench those workers.” “At least 30 000 workers and their families will be affected by this decision. Given that these plants only require about a hundred people to run and maintain them, this means the rest of the workers will languish in poverty caused by unemployment.” Numsa wants guarantees that not a single job at Eskom will be lost as a result of the IPP roll out. -TNA Reporter
