Trade union federation Cosatu on Thursday said it regards itself as one of the biggest influencers when it comes to determining the shape and direction the country is taking economically, politically and socially. “It is an undeniable fact that this time last year, both the ANC and the country were facing great deterioration and possible calamity. It took the political courage of this organised component of the workers to stand up and demand a new political direction for the ANC, the alliance and the country,” Cosatu said. “We did not just pound the pavement but we also engaged in a political battle that shifted the political sands and allowed the new era to be born. We salute the workers for fearlessly leading from the front and not becoming spectators in the unfolding political events in the country.” Cosatu further called on the ANC to reject the resurfacing of narrow Africanism which was tied to what it called “populist demagoguery” within and outside the ranks of the broader movement. “Cosatu is also clear that the strategic task of regaining the unity of our people will not be possible without us proceeding with the second more radical phase of our revolution and to be precise, with a more radical economic transformation to overcome systematic features of growing unemployment, obscene inequality and mass poverty.” To be more precise, we cannot effectively mobilise and unite our people without a programme aimed at ending monopoly capitalism, accelerating state-led industrialisation, overcoming apartheid spatial inequality and advancing our massive education and training programme.” -TNA Reporter
