South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) will proceed with the payment to grant recipients on April 1 as it has always been able to. The announcement was made after concerns were raised about the agency being able to make payments due to the day being a public holiday and falling on the weekend. Sassa also had its illegal contract with Cash Paymaster Service (CPS) extended by six months by the Constitutional Court after the South African Post Office (SAPO) announced that it would not be able to deliver grants to recipients before September. “All our systems are ready, beneficiaries are assured that they will receive their social grants come 1st April 2018 without any disruptions,” said Sassa Spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi. Letsatsi said bank payments and Sassa card payments which are accessed through ATM’s and retailers will be made on 1st April while payments at pay points will start on Tuesday, April 3. -TNA Reporter
