The North West health committee chairperson Somadoda Sambatha has ordered the health department on Tuesday to deliver an annual performance plan that details how to end contracts with Mediosa Company. “I want the health department to deliver an Annual Performance Plan that explains its intention to end contracts with private companies such as Gupta linked Mediosa,” Sambatha said. The department was represented by new acting Health HOD Vuyo Mbulawa who has been asked to act indefinitely following Thabo Lekalakala’s forced annual leave. Lekalakala is currently facing a case of fraud and corruption opened by the committee last week Friday at Mmabatho police station. This is after the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation raided Mahumapelos offices following the investigation into the R160-million fraud, corruption, and maladministration. The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) at the Legislature had previously asked the health MEC and premier to suspend HOD Lekalakala following fraud allegations. However, premier Supra Mahumapelo warned the legislature not to blur the lines when instructing his office about the Health Department’s HOD. The committee chairperson defended the committee’s position saying that the HOD confessed to having misled the local government, but they were surprised to see that his confession didn’t warrant a suspension. The portfolio committee is currently logged into the meeting discussing the issue. -Sipho Jack
