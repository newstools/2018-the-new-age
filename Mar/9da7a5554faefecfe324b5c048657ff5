Charges against baby Siwaphiwe’s biological father Phumlani Mbokazi were withdrawn by the NPA on Tuesday after it found the 26-year-old had intention to commit an offense. Mbokazi had originally been charged with defeating the ends of justice and fraud alongside Siwaphiwe’s mother Sibongile Mbabo. Reports last year that the baby girl had been abducted from Durban’s city centre triggered a massive search by police, security firms and the general public. The case even trended on social media. The baby was found by police two days after she’d been reported missing, at the Mariannhill Toll Plaza in Durban. Baby Siwaphiwe’s mother then admitted to staging the kidnapping. She was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment in January after pleading guilty for her role in the sham. Mbokazi had reportedly made representations to the Director of Public Prosecutions, insisting that he had been acting in the best interest of his baby. His submissions to the court stated that evidence showed that he did not intentionally or unlawfully make a false report of the robbery, thereby defrauding the state. -TNA Reporter
