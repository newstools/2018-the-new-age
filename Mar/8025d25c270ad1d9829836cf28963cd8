The ANC in the Western Cape on Wednesday expressed shock over the passing of provincial executive committee (PEC) member Elese Depouche. According to the party, Depouche was shot at his home at around 8pm on Tuesday evening. It is still unclear who is responsible for the shooting. “The ANC celebrates the spirit of resilience and good humour of Depouche, which would see him through a lot of political challenges and personal sacrifices in the project of fighting for the better life of our people,” the ANC said in a statement. “Comrade Depouche was resilient, patient and had an indomitable spirit. He did not stand for those so well served by the present conditions at the expense of others, he became involved in developing young people in his community, he raised money for the poor in his community and he continued to fight for others to get a better deal out of life.” The ANC further said the challenges Depouche faced in his community did not cause him to surrender to self-pity and regret, adding that such challenges did not make him retreat from his political commitment and public life. “We hope that as we take time to reflect on his life, we can look at lives beyond our own, the majority of our people still languishing in informal settlements and slums and stifling environments in the townships.” -TNA Reporter
