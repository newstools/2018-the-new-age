Three North West police officers who were involved in an accident along the R61 road near Xholosini village at Ngcobo in the Eastern Cape last month, will be given an official funeral this weekend. Police spokesperson Brigadier Sabata Mokgwaabone said, “two of the officers will be laid to rest in Taung and the other one will be buried at Madibogo outside Mahikeng”. The officers were on their way to Eastern Cape area from North West to help boost the Ngcobo killings police task team. A case of culpable homicide has been opened. MEC for Community Safety and Transport Management, Dr Mpho Motlhabane during the memorial service that was held on Wednesday at Mmabana Cultural Centre, Taung, said that sadness has engulfed them as they have lost these three police officers far away in the Eastern Cape, Engcobo area where they were deployed on a special mission. “These three officers were part of a highly skilled trace and tracking investigating squad,” said Motlhabane. He added, “these members possessed special skills and knowledge that is rare and much needed in the country and that they were actually operationalising the call against criminals that, ‘you can run but you can’t hide’. These officers lived and died for a purpose. One must live life, always conscious of the Soil, the Flag and the Oath you take”. Last month, five members of the SAPS and a soldier were allegedly shot dead by unknown gunmen. Warrant Officer Zuko Mbini, 45, Constable Zuko Ntsheku, 38, Nkosiphendule Pongco, 32, Sibongiseni Sondlana, 32 and Kuhle Metete, 27 were mowed down by a group of unknown men who entered the Ngcobo police station and randomly opened fire. Another victim who was hit and killed by a stray bullet near his home is a retired soldier Freddy Mpandeni, 58, who lived close to the police station. -TNA Reporter
