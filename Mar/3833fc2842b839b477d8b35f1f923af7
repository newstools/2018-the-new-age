South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) Governor Lesetja Kganyago on Sunday announced that VBS Mutual Bank will be placed under curatorship. The announcement comes after National Treasury instructed municipalities to stop investing with the bank. Municipalities withdrew about R1 billion from the cash-struck bank. “Curatorship presents the most suitable and most effective mechanism to facilitate the orderly management of the bank. Through curatorship the Sarb is given the legal means to create the necessary mechanism to implement a resolution plan which will seek to ensure the sustainability of VBS,” Kganyago said. “With the appointment of the curator the current board and management are relieved of their powers and these are vested in the curator.” President Cyril Ramaphosa has been asked to intervene in the VBS Mutual Bank crisis. -TNA Reporter
