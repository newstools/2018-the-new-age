THE Governing Body Foundation has raised concerns over the poor turnout by parents at the school governing body (SGB) elections that have been taking place throughout the month. CEO of the foundation, Tim Gordon, said while the low turnout would not directly affect the results of the elections, it was worrying that parents had not taken the opportunity to have their say in choosing or becoming representatives on the SGB. “It is a pity that the SGB members will be elected by a small group of parents as opposed to a large group,” Gordon said. He said while there was an element of parents not understanding the difference between SGB meetings and elections, it was sometimes the case that parents who felt somewhat satisfied with the running of the school, did not show up. “SGBs are the third tier of school governance. They are really important. It is disappointing that parents do not get involved. In some cases, however, it is because there is no recognisable school community. “People have to walk long distances, parents do not even see the school so it is not easy for them to take part,” he said. Gordon said things could be improved if the election regulations were altered, making it easier for parents to actively take part. “There should be things like electronic voting. The period of elections should be made longer and there needs to be pre-nomination options as opposed to the nomination at meetings,” Gordon said. He further said there was a need for a change in the mindset of parents who ought to understand their crucial role in the governance of schools. SGB elections have been taking place since March 1 and will end on Saturday at schools across the country. lillians@thenewage.co.za
