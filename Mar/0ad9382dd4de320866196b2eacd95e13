Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa has congratulated Sasol and Air Liquide for establishing the world’s largest oxygen production plant. The plant was built by Sasol and Air Liquide to the value of R2.9 billion in Secunda, Mpumalanga and it started operating last month. Air Liquide designed, built and will run the plant, which is the largest air separation unit ever built. The design is based on Air Liquide proprietary technologies which include several first of their kind innovations in the air compression process that will allow for an annual electricity consumption reduction of more than 20% (compared to the first generation of Air Separation Units). Molewa said the occasion marked one of the great strides in the country’s ongoing efforts to encourage both local and international investments in order to grow the economy and ultimately improve the lives of South Africans. She said having the 17th Oxygen train was a great initiative for Mpumalanga and South Africa and will go a long way in creating much-needed jobs in the province. “I would like to use this opportunity to encourage further investment in South Africa so that we can reach the levels of growth required to meaningfully decrease our high levels of unemployment and poverty. -TNA reporter
