President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on South Africans to take a moment to register and check their addresses on the voters’ roll, in order to be able to take part in the 2019 general elections. Ramaphosa said by registering to vote, South Africans would be taking part in the healing of the country. He was speaking during the ANC’s election campaign in Pretoria where he urged South Africans to check and confirm their addresses and details on the voters’ roll during this weekend’s IEC election registration drive. Ramaphosa, Gauteng Premier David Makhura, ANC Head of Elections Fikile Mbalula and other ANC heavyweights will on Sunday visit several voting stations, churches and taxi ranks in Tshwane to encourage potential voters to register, and those who registered in the past to confirm their details and addresses on the voters’ roll. On Saturday, Ramaphosa took the party’s message to Soweto where he interacted with party faithfuls and also met ANC stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. The IEC said is it targeting more young people and first-time voters during this weekend’s registration drive. Meanwhile, the registration process has not been smooth in several parts of the country, as there have been incidents of disruptions. Voting stations in Katlehong on the East Rand in Johannesburg, Vuwani in Limpopo, Marikana in the North West and Dunoon and Gugulethu in Western Cape were interrupted by several service delivery-related disruptions. -TNA Reporter
