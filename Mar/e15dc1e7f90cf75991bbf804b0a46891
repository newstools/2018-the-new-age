The Mookgopong Magistrate’s Court in Limpopo has ordered that controversial “prophet” Lethebo Rabalago pay a fine of R15 000 for spraying his congregants with a substance used to kill insects (Doom) during church services. Rabalago was sentenced to four years imprisonment or a fine of R6 000 for contravening the act and three years in prison or a fine of R30 000 for assault charges. But later on, Judge Frans Mohodi suspended the sentence and ordered that the pastor pay half of the fine, R15 000, which will be paid in increments of R3 000 a month. Last month, Rabalago was found guilty on two counts of contravening the Stock and Agricultural Remedies Act and five counts of assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm. Rabalago, also known as the “Prophet of Doom,” first made headlines when a video circulated on social media showing him spraying Doom on his congregants, to heal them. According to reports, Lethebo said he used Doom to heal people suffering from diseases like cancer and HIV. -TNA Reporter
