The Constitutional Court will rule on the fate of more than 1.3 million KwaZulu-Natal voters over whether they can take part in the 2019 general elections, despite not having addresses. The IEC in the province made the announcement on Tuesday while launching a voter campaign to get voters to visit voting stations to update their details on 10 and 11 March, ahead of the 2019 general elections. The court had previously ruled that the IEC had failed to collect and maintain addresses in order to keep and maintain a credible voters roll. The Electoral Court ordered the IEC to postpone by-elections in Tlokwe after independent candidates successfully complained, arguing that the commission was compelled to provide addresses for every eligible voter on the voters roll. According to IEC KZN spokesperson Thabani Ngwira, the voters roll showed that there were more than five million registered voters in the province, 555 979 of whom have no addresses and 823 616 who have incomplete addresses. Ngwira said the total number of registered voters without addresses is 388 595 in the province. “4793 voting stations will be open in the province between 8am and 5pm, to assist with new voter registration, registered voters who have moved and voters who had incomplete information,” Ngwira said. The three municipalities with the highest numbers of voters without valid addresses are eThekwini with 291 005, uMgungundlovu with 40 950 and Zululand at 34 566. The IEC will at the weekend host national voter registration drive aimed at ensuring compliance with the 2016 Constitutional Court ruling to obtain information about more than 26 million eligible voters’ residences by the end of June 2018. -TNA Reporter
