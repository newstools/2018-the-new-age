Newly appointed Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe has vowed to finalise the new Mining Charter by no later than June this year. Mantashe was announced as Mineral Resources Minister by President Cyril Ramaphosa during the reshuffling of his Cabinet earlier this week. Chamber of Mines Spokesperson Charmaine Russell on Thursday refused to answer questions on whether they had already had any interaction with Mantashe since his appointment as minister. “I am afraid we must decline to comment on that question,” Russell said. “We do not have a view on the minister’s comments in respect of timing. That lies in the hands of the minister.” Two weeks ago, Ramaphosa pleaded with the Chamber of Mines to delay its High Court application to set aside the charter, as proposed by then Minister Mosebenzi Zwane, who had a very acrimonious relationship with it. The mining industry had broken off talks with Zwane and said the new charter, as pushed by Zwane, would drive many companies out of business. Zwane proposed raising the target for black ownership to 30% from 26%, which the charter thought was unreasonable. -TNA Reporter
