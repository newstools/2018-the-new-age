The protesters in the #FakeProphetsMustFall handed over a memorandum to the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL Rights Commission) in Johannesburg. The march organised by Solomon Izang Ashoms was meant to stand in solidarity of people who have fallen victim of false prophets in the country. Reading the memorandum the organiser said, “We victims and supporters of victims of false prophets are committed to the church and its leadership. We have no hidden agenda against any individual or church”. Ashoms said that the march and their actions were motivated by the pain caused by some pastors, apostles, bishops, and prophets to so many people especially, women who get abused and raped. “We believe that it is time to seriously acknowledge that certain leaders within the church are abusing their position.” The march comes in the wake of the recent controversial Mancoba Seven Angels Ministries church, which received criticism and labelled a cult by the CRL Rights Commission. The protest-march was met by a legal action on Tuesday from Prophet Shepherd Bushiri who wanted the organisers to remove his name from the promotional material of the march, the organisers had inserted the phrase #BushiriMustFall on their pamphlets. He also wanted the organisers to refrain from making defaming statements against him and further make a public apology. The court ruled in Bushiri’s favour for his name to be removed. @ANN7tv pic.twitter.com/DPvfen83SV — #KeMotswana (@IamTlotlego) March 14, 2018 “Matla Sona ke bophelo” @ANN7tv pic.twitter.com/XYCAfGC0mL — #KeMotswana (@IamTlotlego) March 14, 2018 #MarchAgainstFalseProphets A group of marchers heading to CRL to hand over a memorandum. @The_New_Agepic.twitter.com/7VitcfmhYm — Dikeledi R Molobela (@Dikeledi_Rams) March 14, 2018 – -TNA Reporter
