Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) has welcomed a decision by President Cyril Ramaphosa to suspend South African Revenue Service (Sars) Commissioner Tom Moyane earlier this week. However, BLSA has expressed dissatisfaction with Moyane’s move to challenge his suspension. “Regrettably, BLSA notes an intention by Moyane to resist his removal from office, citing technical and procedural flaws. While we respect his right to challenge his suspension, we believe that it is important for him to step aside to enable Sars to focus on its constitutional mandate,” BLSA CEO Bonang Mohale said on Thursday. Moyane has written to Ramaphosa to express his disapproval of the decision to suspend him, which according to him is “unlawful”. “It is indisputable that the process adopted by you is unlawful and unconstitutional in that you have made a decision to dismiss or suspend without affording me an opportunity to be heard,” Moyane said in a letter to Ramaphosa on Tuesday. Moyane further threatened to proceed to the courts to overturn Ramaphosa’s decision. “In this regard, I intend to approach the court to institute an urgent interdict if you fail to adhere to the required undertaking as stated hereunder.” Meanwhile, BLSA said following Moyane’s suspension, which was “long overdue in the context of all the state capture and corruption allegations that have been leveled against SARS”, Moyane must now face a disciplinary procedure against him. “Sars is too important to be mired in controversy and uncertainty regarding its senior leadership,” Mohale said. -TNA Reporter
