Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene is alleged to have used his political influence to put pressure on the ANC to drop its plans a motion to nationalise the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) last week. This is according to a report by the Sunday Times. It is alleged that the motion, which was due to be debated in Parliament on Tuesday, was dropped in the last minute because credit ratings agency Moody’s was in the country. Nene is reported to have told the ANC’s political strategy committee last week not to go ahead with the planned motion over fears that continuing with the debate might lead to the markets being unsettled, and another downgrade. According to reports, a member of Parliament allegedly revealed that the minister told the ANC that “the timing was not good because Moody’s is in the country.” The ANC withdrew its planned motion debate on the ownership of the Reserve Bank in the National Assembly last week. The party could not disclose more reasons then but said that the decision was taken to allow for greater consultation within the structures of the ANC and key stakeholders. -TNA Reporter
