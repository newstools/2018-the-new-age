One man has been killed and eight others injured when a bakkie rolled on the R54 in Vereeniging. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene to find the bakkie lying on its side on the side of the road. Several people were found lying around the vehicle. “Paramedics assessed the patients and found that one man lay trapped beneath the overturned bakkie. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for him and he was declared dead.” He said eight other patients were assessed by paramedics. A man and woman, believed to be 6-months pregnant, had sustained critical injuries while the remaining six patients had sustained minor to moderate injuries. “Paramedics treated the patients and provided the two critically injured with advanced life support interventions.” Meiring said a short time later, the critically injured woman was airlifted by the ER24 Oneplan Helicopter to a nearby hospital for urgent treatment. “The remaining patients were transported by ambulance to nearby hospitals.” Local authorities were on the scene for further investigations. -TNA Reporter
