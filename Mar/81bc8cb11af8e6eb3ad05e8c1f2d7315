PARLIAMENT’S Eskom Inquiry is considering subpoenaing Dudu Myeni to attend a hearing or inviting her be present herself next week after the former SAA Board chairperson snubbed the investigation into the state-owned entity. Other members of ANC Member of Parliament Zukiswa Rantho, who is leading the Inquiry, said she would consult Parliament’s lawyers before deciding on what to do next. Myene was supposed to have been at yesterday’s hearing to answer allegations made against her last year by former Eskom Board chairperson Zola Tsotsi that she and ex-president Jacob Zuma had tried to intervene in Eskom’s affairs. According to Tsotsi’s evidence he had met Myene at Zuma’s official residence in Durban in March 2015. Rantho told yesterday’s meeting that Myeni had been invited to be present yesterday. However, she informed Rantho that she was not coming and would be guided by her lawyer on how to respond. Rantho later said in a statement: “Today we were expecting Ms Dudu Myeni. We have been informed that she is not coming.” -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN|news@thenewage.co.za
