The African National Congress (ANC) will not be fielding a mayoral candidate for the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro Municipality. This is according to the party’s head of election Fikile Mbalula. Mbalula said the decision was in the best interest of the ANC. “We are not position, grabbers. We will go back to the people to seek an outright majority. We will support any mayoral candidate that other parties want,” he said. Mbalula said what was important for the ANC was to support the motion of no confidence. He added that the ANC had never believed in the Democratic Alliance (DA), saying that the party plunged the municipality in absolute paralysis. While addressing his supporters at Port Elizabeth EFF leader Julius Malema said they were using the Nelson Mandela Bay to demonstrate how serious his party is about the land issue. Malema told his supporters that the EFF cannot support a government that did not support the expropriation of land. “Trollip is a national chairperson of the DA and chaired a meeting that decided to go against us on the issue of land, we cannot go with a government that is not going to expropriate land,” he said. Malema further told his supporters that they did not mind Trollip running the municipality, but he should run it by EFF’s mandate. “If he wins tomorrow we will withdraw from voting with them on anything until they are clear with us on the issue of land expropriation without compensation.” -Sipho Jack
