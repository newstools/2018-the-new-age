THE former head of crime intelligence, Lt-Gen Richard Naggie Mdluli, is not being investigated in connection with a robbery at OR Tambo International Airport last year, Police Minister Bheki Cele said in a written reply to a parliamentary question about the matter from DA member Zakhele Mbhele. Mbhele asked in a written question if the SAPS was investigating any links between Mdluli and the robbery at OR Tambo International Airport in May last year when a group of armed men, some of whom were wearing police uniforms, entered the airport, went to a sealed container and removed an estimated R24m in foreign currency. Cele said the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation Hawks is investigating the robbery at the OR Tambo International Airport and the case number was Ortia, CAS 30/03/2017, armed robbery with aggravating circumstances. “The Hawks are is not investigating any links with regards to Richard Naggie Mdluli. No information or evidence has been established implicating him in the investigation.” Mdluli, who headed crime intelligence from 2009 to 2012 and was suspended for seven years, stepped down from the SAPS in January this year. He is on trial in the South Gauteng High Court for assault and kidnapping. Replying in writing to another written question, Cele told another DA MP, Dianne Kohler-Barnard, about the service record of another former crime intelligence officer, Capt Morris Tshabalala, also known as Capt KGB Tshabalala, who is imprisoned and faces charges of fraud, theft and corruption. Cele said the record reflected that SAPS appointed Tshabalala for the first time as a crime intelligence gatherer in terms of a six-month fixed-term contract on July 2, 2001. His contract ended in December 2001. He was subsequently enlisted as a permanent member of the SAPS on November 27, 2002. He started off as a constable and progressed to the rank of captain, with effect from August 1, 2005. -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN|news@thenewage.co.za
