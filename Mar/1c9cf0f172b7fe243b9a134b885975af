Two South African Revenue Service (Sars) officials, who work in the customs department, are expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, on charges of corruption. The suspects, aged 43 and 44, were arrested in a sting operation involving the Hawks’ Durban Serious Corruption Investigation, Crime Intelligence and members of the Special Task Force Unit last Thursday. The two men allegedly demanded R200 000 bribe from a businessman in order to evade tax obligations. “The matter was reported to the Hawks and an undercover operation was conducted. They were caught red-handed after receiving cash from the complainant,” KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said. -TNA Reporter
