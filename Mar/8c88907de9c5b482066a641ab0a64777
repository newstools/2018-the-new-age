The DA has accused former Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba of announcing a budget that will cut basic education funding by R7 billion for the next three years. The DA said the cuts, which are from government schools, will cause the further collapse of school infrastructure, affect the number of teachers and weaken the country’s ability to improve performance in vital subjects like maths and science. DA shadow minister for basic education Ian Ollis said there was already a huge school infrastructure backlog across the country and many learners would be unable to access higher education if their school infrastructure was left to degenerate. “A reply to a DA parliamentary question revealed that by December 2016, more than 1000 schools countrywide had been built with inappropriate materials, 66 lacked sanitation and over 4 600 had pit latrines. A further 81 schools had no water supply and 571 had no electricity connection,” Ollis said. “Accelerated Schools Infrastructure Delivery Initiative (ASIDI) projects are only expected to be completed in 2021 and the Department of Basic Education has missed all its ASIDI targets in the past year. Out of a targeted 620 schools, none were connected to electricity and this is just one example of how badly the department is failing at addressing poor infrastructure.” Ollis said the department had enough money to meet its ASIDI targets, yet it was simply not being spent. He said the mismanagement of funds continued to hinder progress in improving schools’ infrastructure. “Cutting essential education funding is unnecessary as the DA has provided a full budget breakdown of how the budget could be balanced without impacting basic education but this was ignored by the ANC government.” Ollis said the DA firmly opposed the R7 billion budget cut and would continue to fight the collapse of the neglect of school infrastructure. -TNA Reporter
