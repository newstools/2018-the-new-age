Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has decided to directly approach the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) to challenge the North Gauteng High Court ruling that she personally carry some of the Reserve Bank’s legal fees in the Bankorp review. The announcement comes after the High Court on Wednesday dismissed her application for leave to appeal the ruling. Back in February, a full bench of the High Court dismissed Mkhwebane’s report into the apartheid era bailout of Bankorp in a case that was brought by Absa, National Treasury, South African Reserve Bank(SARB) and ordered her to pay 15% of the Reserve Bank’s legal costs. In her report, Mkhwebane as part of her remedial actions called on the Special Investigating Unit to recover more than R1 billion from Absa for the bailout. Public Protector Spokesperson Oupa Segalwe said Mkhwebane will file her papers with the SCA as she believes a different court will reach a different conclusion. “Yes, she will appeal. At this stage, we cant say with certainty when she will lodge her papers, but she will,” Segalwe said. He also added that the public protector strongly believes that the personal cost order will have a devastating effect on her office. Meanwhile, Democratic Alliance Chief Whip John Steenhuisen said he will write to National Assembly Speaker, Baleka Mbete as a follow up on the party’s request for Parliament to institute proceedings in terms of section 194 of the Constitution to remove Mkhwebane from her position. “The court’s rejection of her latest attempts to escape liability for her incompetence is yet another warning that Parliament can no longer afford to delay – the proceedings in accordance with section 194 of the Constitution and section 2(1)(c) of the Public Protector Act must commence as a matter of urgency,”Steenhuisen said -TNA Reporter
