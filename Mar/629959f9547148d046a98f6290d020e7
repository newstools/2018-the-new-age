The Paul Kruger and Phabeni Gates of the Kruger National Park have been closed due to service delivery protests. It is reported that the R40 from Hazyview and the R538 have also been closed by protesting residents of the area. SANParks spokesperson Isaac Phaahla said guests should use the Orpen and Malelane Gates until further notice. “Some of our officials will go out today and speak to community leaders about their problems. We hope that the relevant officials will be able to resolve the problem,” Phaahla said. The Kruger National Park is gearing up for one of its peak tourism periods over the Easter weekend and the school holiday. Police are currently on the scene but visitors to the park have been urged to rather avoid those roads. -TNA Reporter
