The NPA is expected to oppose businessman Atul Gupta’s court application in the Bloemfontein High Court on Thursday, to challenge the freezing of R10 million in his personal bank account. NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku last month confirmed that the organisation was preparing court papers to oppose Gupta’s application. This comes after the Gupta brother filed papers with the Bloemfontein High Court, challenging the NPA The Asset Forfeiture Unit to proceed with the freezing of the monies. The Asset Forfeiture Unit alleged that the millions were paid to Gupta from the controversial Estina Dairy Farm project in the Free State. Atul Gupta filed an application on 19 February, which was signed in Dubai. “I became aware on or about 2 February from some other affected parties who have been served with the order that a preservation order has been granted in terms of which seizure and preservation of an amount of R10 million, allegedly in an unknown bank account of mine,” Gupta’s affidavit said. Prosecutors were authorised to freeze R220 million belonging to the wealthy Gupta family, including the R10 million that is alleged to have been illegally transferred to Atul. Atul Gupta and his brother Ajay are currently out of the country and are being investigated for allegations of corruption and state capture. -TNA Reporter
