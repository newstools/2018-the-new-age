Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane will on Tuesday meet with Parliament’s portfolio committee on justice and correctional services. Mkhwebane was meant to meet with the committee last month but the meeting was cancelled following confusion over former President Jacob Zuma’s resignation and Cyril Ramaphosa being elected as his successor. The committee said it wanted to get clarity on some of Mkhwebane‘s public utterances and also question her on the Estina Dairy Farm project, which allegedly channeled money to the Gupta family – some of which was allegedly used to fund a wedding at Sun City in 2013. While releasing her report into the investigation at the dairy farm, Mkhwebane announced that she could not question some of the witnesses that she wanted to question, due to financial constrains. She also previously called on the commission announced by Zuma to investigate allegations of state capture, not only to confine itself to her predecessor Thuli Madonsela’s State of Capture report but also be made to investigate all forms of the capture of the state. She later explained what she meant. The committee chairperson previously said it was not happy with Mkhwebane‘s public pronouncements, hence the call for her to explain herself to Parliament. The EFF and DA have called on Public Protector to resign after the North Gauteng High Court dismissed her report into Absa. Mkhwebane was also ordered to personally pay 15% of the fees tor the Reserve Bank and Absa council. -TNA Reporter
