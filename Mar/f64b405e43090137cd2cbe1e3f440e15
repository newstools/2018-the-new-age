The city of Cape Town has warned residents about scam artists posing as city employees. This after the city learned of reports from Milnerton, Claremont and Rondebosch of residents being fleeced of thousands of rands by a person claiming to represent the city as part of an electricity and/or water meter upgrade project. The city said the scammer tells residents that they are prioritising pensioners for the upgrades and makes them part with significant amounts of cash on the premise that his colleagues will arrive the following day to complete the work. “The city can assure the public that the modus operandi described does not conform with our processes. Our field staff do not handle cash – all such transactions are done at the city’s customer centres or via the appropriate electronic channels,” the city said in a statement. “While the city is currently rolling out an electricity meter replacement programme, the planned replacements are free. Each replacement has a notification number on our internal systems, which the city call centre can verify – should a resident inquire.” “In addition, we do targeted marketing and mailbox drops of any planned work to be carried out in an area.” The city has further urged residents to contact its call centre to confirm whether work is being carried out in their area. “Residents may also ask for a letter of appointment outlining the purpose of the project on a city-labelled letterhead, signed by a city official with contact details on the letterhead.” -TNA Reporter
