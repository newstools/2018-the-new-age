Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has instructed that Eastern Cape provincial offices facilitate a process of issuing documents to Seven Angels Ministry congregants in eNgcobo who were rescued last month. A number of the women from the controversial church were prohibited from acquiring their ID documents by the church while the children were not allowed to go to school. According to the “doctrine” of the church, as revealed in a video during an investigation by the CRL Rights Commission, by one of the leaders, the children were prohibited from going to school because doing so was “evil”. “No individual has the authority to deny any citizen of our Republic their constitutional right to identity through the imposition of their irrational beliefs,” Gigaba said. The church was in the centre of the Ngcobo police station killings that occurred in the area, where five police officers and a retired soldier were killed last month. The suspects in the incident were found harboured on the premises of the church. Seven of the suspects were killed by the police in a shootout at the church while others escaped. About 100 women and children were later freed from the church, which has been described by the CRL Rights Commission as a “cult”. The church has since sparked debate on illegitimate churches. Government officials and civil rights organisations have called for the shutdown of the church. Gigaba has expressed his dismay at the disregard of the law by the church and has declared that government will take action on the infringement of these people’s constitutional rights. “Of particular concern to me, is the exploitation of children and women whose rights have been blatantly disregarded by being denied their basic right, their sense of belonging, their birthright to identity.” -TNA Reporter
