Following an announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday that South African Revenue Service (Sars) Commissioner Tom Moyane had been suspended with immediate effect, DA leader Mmusi Maimane on Tuesday the decision was “right” and “proper”. “The decision by Ramaphosa to suspend Moyane is right and proper. It’s time we get a Revenue Service that will serve with integrity and is not captured, as was the case,” Maimane said. Moyane was allegedly asked to resign voluntarily after an engagement with the president, who expressed to him that he had lost confidence in his leadership. Moyane however apparently declined the president’s request. In a letter, Ramaphosa stated his reasons for suspending Moyane, including him having badly handled the matter of Sars Chief Officer for Business and Individual Tax Jonas Makwakwa, who resigned with immediate effect last week. “Concern was raised in particular about the manner in which Mr Moyane handled the matter of Mr Makwakwa, his treatment of the report given to him by the Financial Intelligence Centre and his failure to immediately report this to the Minister of Finance,” the letter said. Ramaphosa said that public confidence had deteriorated under the leadership of Moyane. “Another concern that was raised was the management of VAT refunds, which had brought Sars into serious disrepute and potentially jeopardised the integrity of Sars as collector of revenue and adversely affected tax morality among tax payers.” Following Moyanes’ suspension, Mark Kingon has been appointed as acting Commissioner at Sars. -TNA Reporter
