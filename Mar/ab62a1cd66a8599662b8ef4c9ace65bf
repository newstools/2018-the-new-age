Western Cape police have confirmed the arrest of two suspects in connection with the murder of a cyclist. A 68-year-old cyclist was stabbed multiple times while cycling on an off-road trail and also robbed of his possessions. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andrè Traut said that upon the arrest, one suspect was in possession of the victim’s bicycle and the other was in possession of the victim’s cellphone. Both suspects are in their 20s and are due to appear in court on Friday in Simons Town, for possession of suspected stolen property. “We are yet to charge a suspect with murder and the circumstances surrounding the matter are still under investigation,” Traut said. -TNA Reporter
