Fifteen people are expected to appear the Durban Commercial Crimes Court on Thursday for driving licence corruption. The suspects, including four drivers licence examiners, a clerk, a cleaner and nine learner licence applicants, were arrested in Howick, KwaZulu Natal on Tuesday in a major crackdown on corruption related to the fraudulent issuing of motor vehicle driving licences. During the arrest, one official was not found and law enforcement officials have issued a warrant of arrest. Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) spokesperson Simon Zwane said: “The arrests followed a year-long investigation in which officials from the Howick driver, learner testing centre were observed engaging in unethical and corrupt conduct at the centre.” Zwane indicated that corruption relating to the issuing of driving licence documents was a major concern and is believed to contribute significantly to road accidents in South Africa. “About 80% of fatal crashes are attributed to human error and the ability of the drivers to handle the vehicle plays an important role in this.” Investigations are continuing and more arrests are expected. -TNA Reporter
