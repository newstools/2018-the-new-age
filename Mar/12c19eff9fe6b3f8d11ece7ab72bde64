Home Affairs department says it respects the decision by the Supreme Court of Appeal which dismissed its application for leave to appeal to grant Fireblade Aviation Fixed-base Aviation Operation (FBO) in January 2016. The department said it will study the ruling and make a determination on the next course of action. “Department of Home Affairs notes and respects the recent appeal dismissal by Supreme Court of Appeal. The Department finds its unfortunate that this case was not heard especially since the merits of this case revolve around services of government should be open to all South African citizens as oppose to one family.” The customs and immigration component was to be conducted by officials of the Border Control Operational Coordinating Committee at premises Fireblade leased from Denel within the precincts of OR Tambo International Airport. In October last year‚ the Oppenheimer family won their court battle to operate the private international terminal‚ with government customs and immigration support‚ after accusing Gigaba of reversing his approval. Last year the North Gauteng High Court allowed the operation of the terminal. -TNA Reporter
