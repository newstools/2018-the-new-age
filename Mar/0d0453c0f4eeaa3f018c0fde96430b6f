The Chamber of Mines on Tuesday said it has noted Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe’s comments following a robust meeting between the two at the weekend. The chamber said the mining industry appreciated what it called real engagement that Mantashe began at the weekend following very little engagement with former minister Mosebenzi Zwane. Earlier on Tuesday, the minister announced that he had set up two teams to discuss possible amendments to the Mining Charter and that they had three weeks to report back on the progress. Chamber spokesperson Memory Johnstone said the chamber was in agreement with most of what the minister proposed. “We are aligned with the minister’s thinking that transformation, competitiveness and growth are and should be mutually reinforcing goals. These imperatives are not at odds with each other,” she said. Johnstone said the chamber would participate in the two technical task teams to discuss the charter and the competitiveness and inclusive growth, with a view of reaching an agreement that would ensure further effective progress on transformation and the sustainability of the industry. “The chamber is seeking a practical and workable outcome that all parties to the charter can accept and defend.” “We look forward to creative thinking on the transformation from all stakeholders which might result in some aspects of a new charter being approached in ways different from the template of the first two iterations of the charter that have operated since 2004.” Johnstone said the chamber looked forward to effective engagement processed that, as Mantashe indicated, should include all interested parties, including representatives of mining communities. -TNA Reporter
