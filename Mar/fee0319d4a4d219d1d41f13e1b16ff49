Saturday, 17 March saw the Nasrec Expo Centre play host to the much-anticipated Major League Gardens. Tickets sold faster than a bullet from a riffle, with people coming from all parts of Johannesburg to come and enjoy a night of bliss, filled with the universal language of music. Major League Gardens is a night where friends, music and socialising become one; a night to kick back and enjoy scenes from Mzansi’s best and biggest. With the stage looking breathtaking, mainly dominated by bright lights as if to signal the beasts of performances for the night, the tone had been set. DJ Tira, Shimza, Black Coffee, Cassper Nyovest, Tshego, Nadia Nakai and Sjava were just some of the artists who serenaded people with their music. It was indeed “the ultimate social festival”. Katlego Mokwena, originally from Soweto, graced the event for the first time with her friends. She expressed her delight. “I think it’s important to support events like this because we are in the same age group as the major league boys, it’s inspiring to see them putting something like this together year in and year out, I hope it grows bigger.” Food, music and drinks were all in abundance. The event was also attended by actress Natasha Thahane, presenter and socialite Moshe Ndiki, and blogger Lasizwe Dambuza. Well done to the Major League Gardens team, their sponsors, artists and supporters who all contributed to a memorable experience. A night that was truly a beautiful mess. -Tlotlego Kgosilentswe
