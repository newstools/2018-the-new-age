A woman is expected to apply for bail in the Zeerust Magistrate’s Court in the North West on charges of murder. The woman was arrested for allegedly poisoning and killing her one-year-old baby. It is alleged that the woman, who was struggling financially, gave her daughter poison known as “Galepirimi”. The baby was then rushed to a local hospital where she was declared dead. Lieutenant-Colonel Amanda Funani said: “The mother allegedly disclosed that she poisoned the baby. A case of murder was ultimately opened and the mother was arrested.” North West police commissioner Lieutenant-General Baile Motswenyane has condemned the incident and urged members of the community to report their challenges to professionals like social workers, to avoid situations like this one. -TNA Reporter
