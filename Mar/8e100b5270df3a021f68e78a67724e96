Tragedy has struck yet again with the death of a second member of Parliament (MP) in the space of a month. ANC MP Fezeka Loliwe was killed in a car crash near the University of Fort Hare on Monday while on her way from her parliamentary constituency office in Fort Beaufort in the Eastern Cape. This is less than three weeks after the death of ANC MP Beatrice Ngcobo. Ngcobo was chairperson of the portfolio committee on tourism at the time of her death. Loliwe, who became an ANC MP in 2014, served as chairperson of the portfolio committee on labour and as the ruling party’s whip on the same committee before that. She was also the ANC’s whip of the party’s disciplinary committee in Parliament. Many will remember Loliwe for her no-nonsense approach and her direct style of questioning shown during the parliamentary inquiry into SABC. ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu said her passing left a deep void within the structures of the ANC caucus and Parliament as a whole. “The people of South Africa have truly been robbed of one of the most dedicated public representatives. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the entire Loliwe family, her friends and her comrades,” Mthembu said. Details of Loliwe’s memorial service and funeral are yet to be announced. -TNA Reporter
