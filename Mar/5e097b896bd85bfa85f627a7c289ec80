THE murder case of University of Johannesburg (UJ) student Palesa Madiba continues to be riddled by mystery and confusion. The police are seemingly nowhere close to solving the case. On Monday the police claimed that they had handed over the docket relating to the case over to the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) but this has turned out to be untrue. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) yesterday said it had not received the docket as claimed by the police. The NPA’s Phindi Louw said while there had been constant interaction between their office and the police, the docket was still with the investigating officer. This in response to the police’s statement on Monday that investigations were at a sensitive stage and the SAPS would not comment further on its developments. The police also said they had been updating the family about progress made on the case. This comes almost five years after Madiba disappeared and two years after her body was found in a shallow grave at the house of a friend she said she would be visiting at the time of her disappearance. It is still unclear what the police have discovered to date or if anyone has been arrested for her murder as the police remain tight-lipped about the developments. Madiba disappeared in August 2013 after saying she was going to visit a friend in Phiri, Soweto. The family at whose house Madiba’s body was found were taken in for questioning, but no one was arrested. In early 2016, Gauteng Premier David Makhura promised that arrests were imminent in her murder but two years later there seems to be no end in sight. -LILLIAN SELAPISA|lillians@thenewage.co.za
