A massive product recall is currently underway in an effort to deal with the listeriosis outbreak. The National Consumer Commission (NCC) has issued notices to recall all products produced by Enterprise Foods and Rainbow Chicken after the Listeriosis outbreak was traced to the companies’ products produced in their Polokwane, Germiston and Free State factories respectively.

All Enterprise products (including the Bokkie, Renown, Lifestyle and Mieliekip brands) have already been recalled by the company concerned and we are urgently withdrawing them from our stores,” Pick n Pay said in a statement. The retail giant also confirmed that Pick n Pay branded chicken polony, manufactured by Rainbow, has also been affected by the recall. Customers who have bought any ready-to-eat meat products have been urged to return said products to stores for a full refund. Meanwhile, Woolworths has also issued a list containing all products eligible for a full refund affected by the recall. WAFERTHIN CHARGRILLED HAM 125G
