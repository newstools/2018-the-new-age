The International Cricket Council (ICC) will on Monday start hearing an appeal brought by world number one Test bowler and South African speedster Kagiso Rabada. Rabada was given a two-match suspension and two demerit points after he was found guilty of shoulder charging Australian batsman Steve Smith during a highly emotional second Test match at St George’s Park. New Zealand lawyer Michael Herron, who is presiding over the case, will deliver his verdict 48 hours after hearing the appeal. If Herron upholds the ICC sanction, Rabada will miss the third Test, which is set to start on Thursday, at Newlands Stadium in Cape Town. Last week, during a press conference, Rabada said he took responsibility for what happened and said he should not have done it. “I take responsibility for what happened. I got into his space‚ so I shouldn’t have done that,” he said in a post-match press conference. Rabada roped in seasoned lawyer and EFF Chairperson Dali Mpofu to be his lawyer during the appeal. Mpofu in 1999 got the High Court to overturn a rape conviction of former Proteas fast bowler Makhaya Ntini. -TNA Reporter
