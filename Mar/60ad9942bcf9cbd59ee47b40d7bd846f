Western Cape Premier Helen Zille has questioned the ‘inaction’ of Life Esidimeni families prior to the victim’s death. Zille asked the families what did they do after finding out the conditions that their loved ones were living under in the NGOs. “It is good that the families of the Life Esidimeni tragedy have seen a measure of justice and compensation. What puzzles me is how these families failed to raise the alarm about their loved ones starving, or living in profound neglect before they died. Answers, please?,” she wrote on Twitter. It is good that the families of the Life Esidimeni victims have received a measure of justice and compensation. I would like an answer to this question: What did they do, before these tragic deaths, to raise the alarm about their loved ones starving + living in profound neglect? — Helen Zille (@helenzille) March 20, 2018 The families allegedly raised the alarm on the conditions that the patients were living under, but the department is accused of having done nothing to heed their call. Retired Judge Justice Dikgang Moseneke said that the Department was warned about the dangers of moving patients but did nothing to heed the call of those warnings and went ahead with the move. On Monday Moseneke announced that government is ordered to pay over R1 million to the claimants of the Life Esidimeni tragedy. Out of that amount, R20 000 was for funeral costs, R180 000 for shock and trauma while R1 million will be paid to all claimants for the breach of the Constitution. -TNA Reporter
