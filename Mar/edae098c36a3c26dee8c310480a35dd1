The African Continental Free Trade Area still has a long way to go before becoming a reality, as several countries, including Nigeria and South Africa, need to consult before signing. This is according to North West University politics and international relations lecturer Dr Norman Sempijja. During an interview with Power Fm on Thursday Sempijja said South Africa stood to benefit if it signed the agreement. “African countries need infrastructure which South Africa can provide. South Africa didn’t sign the agreement, it only signed the Kigali Protocol to allow for greater consultation internally,” Sempijja said. Sempijja’s comments came after President Cyril Ramaphosa urged African countries to do business among each other. Ramaphosa also said the South African government wanted to make it easier for other Africans to do business with it in future, as part of a future African free trade area. The president was speaking in Rwanda, where heads of state in the African Union attended the Extraordinary Summit on the African Continental Free Trade Area. Immediately after the conference closed, Ramaphosa told his Rwandans counterparts should they wish to come to South Africa to do business, it should be allowed. At the same time Sempijja said the challenge that has faced Africa is that it traded more with the outside world. He said the president’s decision to do intra-trade was partly a move away from AGOA, adding that it was a move towards intra-African trade. -Sipho Jack
