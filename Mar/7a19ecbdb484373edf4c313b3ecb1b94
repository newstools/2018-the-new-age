The Kempton Park Magistrate’s Court has ruled on the extradition of convicted Czech crime kingpin Radovan Krejcir. The judge found that not only were the charges against Krejcir viable for prosecution but also that there was a reasonable chance for successful prosecution. Since 2007, the Czech Republic has been trying to have Krejcir extradited from South Africa in order to face charges ranging from conspiracy to commit fraud and murder, evasion of tax, credit fraud, kidnapping and blackmailing, all of which he has been found guilty of in his absence. He is however allowed to have a retrial on all cases if he is extradited, according to Cech law. Justice Minister Michael Masutha is the only person who by law can make an announcement on whether Krejcir can be extradited to his native Czech Republic or remain in South Africa where he is facing several criminal charges. He currently faces charges ranging from murder, to conspiracy to commit murder. Despite facing several charges in South Africa, Krejcir has only been sentenced to 34 years for drug dealing and attempted murder. -TNA Reporter
