The newly appointed minister of police Bheki Cele has fired a stern warning to social media users who have opened a fake Twitter account using his name. In his first statement since taking office on Tuesday, Cele expressed disappointment and disgust at some of the Twitter posts from the fake account. The account was created last month (February) and already has about 4 734 followers.
While some of the tweets are professional others are jokes about Cele’s predecessor Fikile Mbabula. He said the mushrooming twitter handles in his the name were viewed as sinister and aimed at dragging his name into “dirty and tricky mud games in the social media space for reasons best known to the ghost operators”. “Social media remains a respectable communication platform that should be exempted from any abuse by ghost operators. Minister Cele has also observed all social media comments from genuine individuals since his appointment and has positively welcomed and received all of them as building blocks towards a concerted effort in creating a safe South Africa for all,” his spokesperson Nonkululeko Phokane said. It remains to be seen whether the new minister will follow Mbabalula whose prolific tweets won him the title “minister of social media”. kutullom@yahoo.com
