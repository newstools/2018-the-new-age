Limpopo police on Tuesday arrested a police officer and two suspects for alleged theft by false pretenses. The three were arrested during a police operation in the Phiphidi village after the police were alerted about a BMW vehicle that had not paid for refueling at the Muledani filling station. Police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said, after filling up, the three gave the petrol attendant a non-functioning card. “After getting petrol, the driver gave him a bank card to swipe for payment. Unfortunately, it declined and they drove away and disappeared,” Ngoepe said. Ngoepe said during their preliminary investigation, the police discovered that one of the suspects was a police constable attached to a police station outside Pretoria. “During the arrest, a police blue light was also confiscated from the suspects.” According to Ngoepe, the police are investigating whether the three can be linked to other criminal activities that were reported around the province and elsewhere. Ngoepe said the suspects would appear in the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court soon, to face charges of theft by false pretense and possession of suspected stolen property. He said the police were still investigating the case, including the origin of the blue police light. -TNA Reporter
