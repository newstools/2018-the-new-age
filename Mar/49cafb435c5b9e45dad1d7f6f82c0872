EFF Deputy President and parliamentary Chief Whip Floyd Shivambu has warned the DA that the red berets will not take advice from it on losing voters due to them giving Nelson Mandela Bay in the Eastern Cape to the ANC. This comes after DA leader Mmusi Maimane cautioned the EFF that voters would punish them EFF if they returned the metro to the ruling party. Maimane said that if the EFF’s motion of no confidence against Mayor Athol Trollip succeeds, “the EFF must know that voters‚ even their own voters‚ will punish them severely for returning the metro to the corrupt ANC‚ just as it is slowly emerging from the legacy of twenty years of corruption.” However, Shivambu said that the party would go ahead with its motion as it has confidence in its voter support. “We honestly can’t be advised by the DA on whether we will lose votes or not. As a matter of fact, the EFF ’s voter support is, according to scientific research, increasing and the DA’s support is shrinking. The decision on Nelson Mandela Bay is final and the DA should live with it,” Shivambu said. Meanwhile, Maimane also said that he believed the EFF’s motion against Trollip was due to the colour of his skin. “The decision by the EFF to punish the DA and ultimately move against a DA-led mayor because of the colour of his skin is a decision that we simply cannot accept,” Maimane said. -TNA Reporter
