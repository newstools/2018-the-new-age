FOLLOWING former premier of Mpumalanga David Mabuza’s ascension as Deputy President of the Republic, the Mpumalanga executive council has appointed cooperative governance and traditional affairs MEC Refilwe Mtsweni as the acting premier of the provincial government. “Since Premier Mabuza was still competent to exercise the authority of the premier, he appointed MEC Mtsweni as the acting premier, who was subsequently sworn in as the acting premier by the judge president of the Mpumalanga division of the High Court, Francis Legodi, in the Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court,” the provincial government said in a statement. When Mabuza was sworn in as the Deputy President, a vacancy for the premier opened in the province, necessitating the election of the acting premier. Wednesday’s special sitting of the executive council decided to elect an acting premier, pending the preparations for the election of the premier, as determined by Section 128 and 131 of the Constitution. “Acting Premier Mtsweni accepted the appointment and committed her support to work with the members of the executive and to act in accordance with the code of ethics prescribed by the Constitution and the national legislation.” All eyes are now on who will succeed Free State premier and ANC secretary general Ace Magashule. Mashule was elected as secretary general in December at the party’s 54th national elective conference. Magashule, who has been premier for three consecutive terms told guests in his final state of the province address that he was happy to move to the ANC’s headquarters because it created an opportunity of him to fight for radical economic transformation. “We have come to a time when South Africans cannot accept that a minority owns the economy, black people have become impatient are ready to participate in the economy of their country,” Magashule said. sifisom@thenewage.co.za
