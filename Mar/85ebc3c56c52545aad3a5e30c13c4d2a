A briefing by Parliament’s standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) and the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) with an update on the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) and South African Post Office’s (Sapo) grant payment plan has been cancelled. Scopa said it had made a number of attempts to invite the IMC but had not received any communication from it to confirm. Meanwhile, “Sassa has also indicated that it was unaware of the meeting between Scopa and the IMC scheduled for today,” the committee said. The meeting was due to take place in the evening on Tuesday. In a statement, Scopa said that it “remains concerned about the many conflicting reports about the ability of Sassa and Sapo to meet the deadline of 1 April, which might negatively affect grant recipients.” The Post Office is expected to take over grant payments from the 1st of April when the current Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) contract extension with Sassa expires. This comes after Sassa’s contract with CPS was declared invalid in 2014 by the Constitutional Court but an extension was still granted for the continuation of grant payments. Last week, Sassa announced that it and the Post Office were ready to take over grant payments. “We are pleased to announce a significant state of readiness of Sapo. We assure South Africans that social grants will be paid from 1 April. Sassa has been running pilot programmes by making direct payments to beneficiaries,” Sassa CEO Pearl Bhengu said. On efforts to “provide a back-up, should there be any problems with the new payment system,” Sassa approached the Constitutional Court in a bid to extend its contract with CPS for another six months. However, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng last week lambasted Sassa’s six-month extension request. Parliament’s portfolio committee on social development also rejected the proposal last month. -TNA Reporter
