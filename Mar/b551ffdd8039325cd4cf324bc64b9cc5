The Klerksdorp brothel will soon be demolished after a forfeiture order was granted by the North Gauteng High Court. The application came after women and girls from different parts of the country were rescued from the establishment by the Hawks on 16 December 2016. The Priority Crime Specialised Investigations (PCSI) unit of the Hawks in North West gathered evidence which showed that that the property was being used solely for criminal activities in contravention of the Prevention of the Organised Crime Act 121 of 1998. The Hawks Spokesperson in the North West Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso said it was not the first time that the property was raided. “The property was raided twice, first in 2016 when twenty-six women and girls were rescued and again in 2017 where 34 women were again rescued,” Rikhotso said. During the raids, two Nigerian nationals were arrested and will be charged with Human trafficking and possession of drugs. According to Rikhotso, a large amount of money was also seized during the raid. Hawks Provincial Head Major-General Linda Mbana said she welcomed the forfeiture order and the news of the demolition of the property in question. “After a lot of hard work by the Hawks, the AFU and the NPA, the forfeiture order has finally come to fruition. We hope that the demolition of this property will give the community of Pienaarsdorp hope” she said. -TNA Reporter
