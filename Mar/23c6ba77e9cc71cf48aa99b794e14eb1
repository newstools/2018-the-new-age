Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases(NICD) will on Sunday announce new stringent measures aimed at containing the outbreak of listeriosis. This is after a team tasked with the responsibility of identifying the source of the outbreak made a breakthrough at midnight, prompting the minister to call an urgent briefing. Motsoaledi is also expected to name certain foods in which the strain of the bacteria causing the current outbreak has been found and the source as identified by scientists. So far, more than 900  cases of listeriosis have been reported to the NICD with 172 lives already confirmed to have been lost. Gauteng has the highest number of reported cases at 541 followed by KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape. -TNA Reporter
