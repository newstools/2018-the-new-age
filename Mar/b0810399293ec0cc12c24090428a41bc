Parliament’s portfolio committee on communications has rejected Icasa chairperson Rubben Mohlaloga’s request to be placed on precautionary leave. Following Mohlaloga’s conviction of fraud and money laundering by the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crime Court in January, the committee has recommended that he is removed from Icasa’s Council. Chairperson of the Committee Humphrey Maxegwana said the committee took a decision in February to allow Mohlaloga an opportunity to make representations on why he should not be removed. Having reconsidered his representation and consulted with Parliament’s constitutional and Legal Services Office, the committee rejected his request. -TNA Reporter
