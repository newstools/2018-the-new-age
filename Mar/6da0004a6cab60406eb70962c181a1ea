African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Ace Magashule told residents of Kgalaletsang Informal Settlement in the Free State that they should have faith in the ANC led government. Magashule said that there were individuals in the party who were doing bad things in the name of the organisation. He urged residents not be mad with the ANC, but to direct their anger to the individual who was bringing the party into dispute. “Sometimes Ace Magashule does his own bad things, what we should know is that Magashule is not ANC. Tomorrow he might leave the party, and don’t follow him because without ANC he won’t be able to deliver all these things,” Secretary General of the ANC said. He further told residents that leaders make mistakes that tend to taint the image of the ANC, adding that people should continue to have faith that things will only be better going forward. Magashule is in his home province as part of the organisation’s voter registration drive throughout the province. The aim of the drive is to encourage the first-time young voter to go and register for the upcoming national elections. He is also expected to visit North West on Sunday where he will do a church visit at the Uniting reformed church in ward 9 Wolmaranstad. -Sipho Jack
