SA Rugby has confirmed Rassie Erasmus had been appointed as the new Springbok coach to replace Allister Coetzee. The former Springbok captain will undertake the task with three assistant coaches, Jacques Nienaber, Pieter de Villiers and Mzwandile Stick. SA Rugby CEO Jurie Roux said this changes in the team followed a very thorough review process of last season. “Following a very detailed review process of the 2017 season, I believe that we have managed to assemble a strong and experienced Springbok coaching and management staff. We are looking forward to see improved performances this season,” Roux said. Erasmus is optimistic that the team has the capacity to turn things around at the national team ahead of next year’s Rugby World Cup. “It is a huge task to coach the Springboks and I am very privileged,” Erasmus said. The new coach said he would call on franchise coaches to assist him as he embarks on this new challenge. -TNA Reporter
