African Democratic Change (ADeC) founder and president Makhosi Khoza at the weekend denied claims that she had been suspended or resigned from her party. This comes after claims that the former ANC MP had been suspended by her own party. Khoza said that a “nonmember could not expel a member”. “I have not resigned from the ADeC. I have also not been suspended from the ADeC. Wathint’ Abafazi, Wathint’ Imbokodo. I have started this process and will fight on until my last breath. The ADeC is going through a metamorphosis process. We are currently cleaning up our membership system,” Khoza said in a post on Facebook. Former Gauteng EFF leader Lufuno Gogoro, who was rejected admission as a member of the ADeC after failing the moral and ethical leadership test, according to Khoza, on Saturday said: “African Democratic Change founding president Makhosi Busisiwe Khoza [is] suspended with immediate effect. She will be charged soon for bringing the party into disrepute and also for registering an NGO with the same name as African Democratic Change.” He made the claims in a post on Facebook. Khoza said that the claims were as a result of a disgruntled group of people who were “non-members,” who intended to join the party with the intention to use it as a tool to get parliamentary seats. “Some did not qualify as members of ADeC despite having attended our founding congress. These non-members displayed disturbing tendencies. We have even opened a criminal case against them,” Khoza said. “They are fighting back because they thought since this party is woman-led it would be a walk in the park to take it over. They have just entered the wrong movie. Forward ever! Backward Never.” -TNA Reporter
