Proteas fast bowler Kagiso Rabada has been suspended by the International Cricket CouncilÂ  (ICC) following his contact with Steve Smith in the second Test. Rabada has been charged with a Level 2 ICC Code of Conduct offence for making physical contact with Australian captain Steve Smith while celebrating his dismissal on the opening day in Port Elizabeth. The 22-year-old made contact with Smith with his shoulder. Rabada attended a hearing regarding his charge on Sunday, which was convened by match referee Jeff Crowe. The suspension means Rabada will not take part in the rest of the four-match test series. -TNA Reporter
