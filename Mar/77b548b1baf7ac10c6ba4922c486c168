The Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) will on Tuesday launch its study into Vuwani following the outbreak of violent protests over municipal demarcation, which brought the community to a standstill. The study is investigating what the drivers of violence and conflict were over the municipal boundaries in the area and seeks to understand the socio-economic and psychological impact of the violence on learning. On the panel will be HSRC Professor Modimowabarwa Kanyane, Chairperson of the demarcation board Jane Thupana and journalist Tebogo Monama. The organiser of the study Arlene Grossberg said the HSRC undertook a case study in order to look at the protests in Vuwani which among others, saw the community come to a standstill and the destruction of public property. “This case study provides valuable lessons in how to engage meaningfully with communities to ensure responsiveness from the government,” Grossberg said. The seminar can be viewed via video link at HSRC venues in Pretoria, Cape Town and Durban. It can also be viewed on here. -TNA Reporter
