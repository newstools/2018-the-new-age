National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams stands ready to announcement whether former president Jacob Zuma will be prosecuted despite a legal challenge to his employment. The Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac) launched a bid in the Constitutional Court to interdict Abrahams from making his announcement until after a ruling had been made on the status of his employment. This came as judgment was reserved in the ConCourt on whether Abrahams could remain in his post despite the North Gauteng High Court ruling which brought in to question his tenure. NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku said that while Abrahams would await the court ruling, he was ready to make his announcement. “The director has made his decision in respect of the matter. Casac has an application to interdict him. The NDPP has responded to that application by Casac. “The NDPP respects court processes. We’ve filed our papers in response to their papers (Casac), we’ll await the ruling of the ConCourt and we’ll respect the ruling of the ConCourt,” Mfaku said. Casac brought an application in the Constitutional Court in a bid to confirm the high court ruling that set aside Abrahams’ appointment. Casac was of the view that Abrahams was compromised and should not be at the helm of the NPA and deciding on Zuma’s prosecution. Abrahams in his answering affidavit to the ConCourt rejected Casac’s assertion that he was conflicted. “I take strong exception to any suggestion that I lack the requisite independence. “I view any attempt to restrain the decision making powers vested in my office by the Constitution and the legislation thereunder as itself a serious threat to the institutional independence of the NPA,” Abrahams said. -BONOLO SELEBANO|bonolos@thenewage.co.za
