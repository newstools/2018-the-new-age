Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter on Monday confirmed that Orlando Pirates assistant coach Rhulani Mokoena will not be joining the national team for their trip to Zambia. Bafana will participate in the Four Nations Tournament, set to take place in Zambia between 22 and 25 March. The teams in the tournament are Zambia, South Africa, Angola and Zimbabwe. “At this moment in time, Rhulain will not be taking part in our camp. We understand the situation at Pirates and we want everybody to know that the intention was to bring the young upcoming coach to the camp and give him experience,” Baxter said. Baxter said Bafana’s medical team would monitor Bidvest Wits defender Buhle Mkhwanazi’s injury and would make a decision whether he will join the team or not. “Buhle has got a slight hamstring and that will be monitored this afternoon before we go to training.” The first game for Bafana Bafana will be against Angola on Thursday 22 March at 3pm with hosts Zambia taking on Zimbabwe in an earlier fixture at 1pm. Both matches will take place at the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium. -TNA Reporter
