EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu has promised to take action against former President Jacob Zuma, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Senzeni Zokwana and Cosatu President Sdumo Dlamini, who are accused of receiving bribes from an abalone dealer in the Western Cape. The three are alleged to have accepted bribes from the businessman. The City Press at the weekend reported that Zuma is being investigated by the Hawks for allegedly accepting money from the abalone dealer businessman as security for keeping Zokwana in his position. The reports that Jacob Zuma was bribed to keep the extremely mediocre Senzeni Zokwana as Minister are believable. The involvement of Sdumo Dlamini is also believable. We are now going to make sure that they’re exposed and held accountable. They’ll all Fall! — Floyd Shivambu (@FloydShivambu) March 26, 2018 The paper also reported that, according to an affidavit forwarded to the police in Pretoria, Dlamini and another Agriculture Department deputy director-general each also received a R300 000 bribe from the same businessman. Dlamini has since denied the allegations. SACP Second Deputy General Secretary Solly Mapaila said the party saw the allegations against Zokwana and Dlamini as a smear campaign. “We currently view them as mere allegations. We have spoken to our chairperson who has denied the allegations. I also spoke to Dlamini, who is also our member and he actually denied all of this to the extent that he has not even been spoken to by anyone including the police. So, it was just a shock for him that he hears this in this case but we’ll apply the same measure will have said about comrade Zokwana.” Mapaila said. -TNA Reporter
