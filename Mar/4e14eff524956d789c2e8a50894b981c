THE city of Johannesburg yesterday served a legal notice to street pole advertising company Adreach. The company has been given 30 days to align itself with municipal by-laws after Adreach failed to comply with the Joburg Property Company’s notice of termination of its memorandum of agreement signed in February last year. “This notice has been ignored by Adreach, which has resulted in the city issuing a final letter of demand, giving the company 30 days to comply. “Failure to comply will result in the city removing all street pole advertising and claiming the costs from Adreach,” MMC for department of economic development, Leah Knott, said. The first notice also required Adreach to remove its advertising and repair any damage to city property caused by advertising boards, within 90 days. “This is the first decisive move from the city in what is a broader approach to address the anarchy that has come about in the outdoor advertising industry in Joburg. The city aims to reduce the clutter in Joburg and reintroduce control and regulation in outdoor advertising,” Knott said. He said the administration acknowledged Joburg was the only city in the country that had lost control of its outdoor advertising She said Adreach was not the only offender as almost all outdoor companies were operating illegal signs and billboards to some extent. The city’s new by-laws regarding outdoor advertising will pass through the council this month, she said. shonisanit@thenewage.co.za -SHONISANI TSHIKALANGE
