ALMOST five years after she disappeared and two years after her body was found in a shallow grave, University of Johannesburg (UJ) student Palesa Madiba’s murder case is still unsolved. It is still unclear what the police have discovered to date or if anyone has been arrested for her killing. Gauteng police spokesperson Brig Mathapelo Peters said not much could be revealed about the case as investigations were still at a sensitive stage. “TThe docket has been handed over to the director of Public Prosecutions for a decision,” Peters said. Madiba disappeared in August 2013 after saying she was going to visit a friend in Phiri, Soweto. Her skeletal remains were found buried in a shallow grave at the same friend’s house two years later on December 16 following a tip-off. The family at whose house Madiba’s body was found were taken in for questioning, but no one was arrested. Premier David Makhura promised in 2016 that arrests were imminent and investigations were at an advanced stage but two years later there seems to be no end in sight. The police are yet to give an update on the investigation into Senzo Meyiwa’s murder. The former Bafana Bafana captain was shot dead at the home of his girlfriend singer Kelly Khumalo in Vosloorus in 2014. Former police minister Fikile Mbalula last month promised there would be an update on the case. This came after a social media uproar over a series of tweets by a parody Twitter account claiming the police had all at their disposal to make arrests. However the new police ministry yesterday said there was nothing to report on the matter. “Once the information is available, we will communicate it accordingly,” police spokesperson Nonkululeko Phokane said. -LILLIAN SELAPISA|lillians@thenewage.co.za
