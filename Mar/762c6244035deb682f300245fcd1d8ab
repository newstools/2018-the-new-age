THE 22-year-old woman killed by a lioness at the Dinokeng Game Reserve in Hammanskraal was not a guest at the reserve but had accompanied a friend for an interview, Kevin Richardson of the Wildlife Sanctuary said. Richardson said the young woman was not a guest at the camp, but had accompanied her friend to conduct an interview for an assignment with the camp’s manager. “Before leaving the reserve, the two visitors were taking photographs outside the camp when the attack occurred,” Lloyd said. The wildlife sanctuary said it was saddened by the incident that occurred in the camp on Tuesday. “We are deeply saddened and shocked by the death of a 22-year-old woman at our tented camp in the Dinokeng big five game reserve. “Our condolences and heartfelt sympathies go out to her family at this difficult time.” The identity of the woman was still being kept under wraps yesterday. “Myself and an experienced colleague took three lions walking in the reserve, as we do on a weekly basis, as part of their exercise and stimulation regimen. “We assessed the landscape for other big five animals and as per procedure sent out a notification that we were walking in the reserve. “One of the lionesses charged off after an impala and must have run 2- 2.5km where she encountered the 22 year old,” Richardson said. Cullinan police spokesperson Const Connie Mogamedi said police had launched an investigation regarding the matter. “It is understood that the woman was walking to the car with her friend when the animal attacked her.” charloteh@thenewage.co.za
