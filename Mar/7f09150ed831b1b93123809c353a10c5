Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan will this week address the Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) Leadership Session to share their economic strategies. Nene and Gordhan will on Monday and Tuesday share their views on how the country will create jobs and grow the economy. President Cyril Ramaphosa has indicated the importance and success of the new economic agenda for South Africa. “We will do this by getting social partners in our country to collaborate in building a social compact on which we will create drivers of economic recovery. We have to build further on the collaboration with business and labour to restore confidence and prevent an investment downgrade,” Ramaphosa said. Ramaphosa said jobs and an investment summit are critical to take the country forward. Nene and Gordhan were appointed following a Cabinet reshuffle by Ramaphosa last Monday. -TNA Reporter
