The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) in the North West is on Tuesday expected to march against corruption and also to call on the ANC to remove Premier Supra Mahumapelo. The union is accusing Mahumapelo of facilitating corruption in the province. Provincial deputy secretary Toffies Moemi said the province is riddled with corruption, adding that the Mediosa scandal bears testimony to the high level of corruption. Earlier this month, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi described the Mediosa contract as a mobile ATM card used by the Gupta family to withdraw money from the government. Mahumapelo did not take kindly to minister’s remarks, accusing Motsoaledi of choosing a populist approach instead of approaching the provincial government regarding the matter. At the time, provincial spokesperson Brian Setswambung said Mahumapelo had decided to elevate the matter to President Cyril Ramaphosa. “The premier has, as a result, stated that he will communicate with the Presidency now that the minister has unfortunately chosen to ignore the province, because the province would have basically appraised the minister on work that is being done on this particular matter,” Setswambung said. Meanwhile, Mahumapelo is also facing a motion of no confidence, tabled by the EFF, on 17 April. Provincial Legislature speaker Sussana Dantjie’s announced the motion last week . During a radio interview on Thursday, Mahumapelo said he was not shaken by the EFF’s motion, saying that was what was keeping him excited. He added that should his organisation ask him to step down, he would gladly do it. -TNA Reporter
