Civil rights organisation AfriForum on Monday said it would launch a website where members of the public could support a petition aimed at encouraging governments and foreign investors to put pressure on the South African government not to continue with land expropriation without compensation. This after the tabling of a motion to amend the Constitution in order to enable expropriation of land without compensation last week. The EFF tabled the motion which was seconded by the ANC. AfriForum deputy CEO Ernst Roets said a memorandum would be directed to international society in which foreign investors would be warned that their investments in South Africa were not safe. “In order to illustrate the extent of the crisis, we encourage the public to add their names to the petition and to advise their friends, family and colleagues to do the same,” Roets said. He said the motion to expropriate land without compensation was based on a contortion of the past and it was an application of ideological principles that led to depression, poverty and starvation worldwide. “The cornerstone of economic growth is property rights. There are a lot of better ways to promote economic growth in South Africa. As such, there are also more efficient ways to ensure that black people own more land to the extent to which there is a need, therefore.” Roets said AfriForum was aware the idea of a petition could be regarded as a drastic step but added that it was a vital last alternative to prevent the government from destroying the country’s economy to the detriment of everyone in the country. -TNA Reporter
