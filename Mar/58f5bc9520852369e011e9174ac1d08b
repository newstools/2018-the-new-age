The North West health department has apologised for administering birth control injections without the consent of pupils or their parents. The department on Thursday said it had reflected on an incident where birth control injections were given to pupils at Pitso-Letlhogile Secondary School in Phaposane near Ganyesa. Even though – according to the department – this was done with the best intentions by the sub-district, it did not sit well with the parents and the affected pupils. Spokesperson Tebogo Lekgethwane said the department admitted that there should have been thorough consultation, especially with the affected parties. Lekgethwane said the department had commended the oversight role of the portfolio committee on health and social development in the matter. “The manner in which the activity was carried out is regrettable since it left learners feeling that their rights, particularly the right to human dignity and the right to privacy, were infringed upon,” Lekgethwane said. “The department admits that both parents and learners’ consent should have been thoroughly sought, agreed to and consent forms signed.” Attempts to get a comment from the Commission on Gender Equality’s Jabu Baloyi were unsuccessful as his cellphone went unanswered. However, the Human Rights Commission in the province said it is aware of the case. An official from the commission – who refused to give his name – said the commission is investigating the case. -TNA Reporter
