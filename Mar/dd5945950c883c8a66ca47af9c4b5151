IN A sign of confidence in the South African economy, a German family owned investment company has made a bid to buy out SA construction giant Murray & Roberts. The company, Aton, already owns a third of M&R, which is attracting new orders after a decade-long slump. Aton said the offer represents “a vote of confidence in the South African economy by a large multinational German investor”. News of the planned buyout sent the M&R share price surging 51% yesterday. Aton said that Allan Gray which owns 10.9% of the SA firm, had given an “irrevocable undertaking” to accept R15 a share for its stake. The deal values the South African company at nearly $600m (R7bn). Dr Lutz Helmig founded the company that became Helios Hospital Group. Before selling the hospital for $2bn in 2005, he founded Aton GmbH, which serves as his family’s investment company. He has an estimated net worth of $2.6bn. -THELMA NGOMA
